Wow. Been a while, huh? We've got a lot to cover, so let's get going:

WWIV 4.23:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

If you've not bothered to upgrade to 4.23, here's what you're missing:

 1) Almost all known bugs fixed. More on this in a minute.
 2) PW not showing in INIT startup.
 3) Up to 250 chars for E-Mail name (good for gateway routing).
 4) //UPLOADFILE reads extended descriptions also.
 5) NET31 and earlier bug in //BOARDEDIT not allowing net subs to be added
 6) Color changes in [PAUSE] now supported.
 7) Moving file optionally resets daten for nscan searches.
 8) by/re/internal editor commands (/es, ...) now in BBS.str
 9) Multiple languages supported.
10) Multiple fast local logons for sysops (with <space>num).
11) Remote autovalidation (1,2..0 keys act as AltF1-AltF10 would) when in
    uedit.
12) 255 SL protection from Alt-F keys and remote autovalidation.
13) Better pending display. Shows all network connections rather than just
    those with bytes waiting. Also shows to minute accuracy rather than
    hour accuracy. This display is now abortable.
14) Autodialing for network callouts. Can specify number of retries.
    Abortable with ESC key. Key is '.' at wfc for autodialing, '/'
    does just one try as usual.
15) Can specify minimum k before network callout. One-day override: if an
    entire 24 hours goes by and the minimum k is not reached, then the
    BBS will start calling again as if there were no minimum k defined.
    NET33 required (so that a re-analysis doesn't erase the |<num> entry).
16) Support for colors 8 and 9 in messages, defaults, etc.
17) Topscreen/F1 color setting changed to white on blue (and uses a #define
    for easy alteration). editline color also #define'd in CONIO.C for
    easy customization.
18) F1 editor edits more fields, including banktime, ass_pts, msgs posted,
    upload k, etc. 60-char notes now handled properly.
19) Local posts and network posts tracked separately. Topscreen shows no. of
    local posts for the day.
20) Randomized ANSI logon screens (WELCOME.0, .1, etc). Maximum of 1000
    random screens, but no hard-coded maximum; code adjusts to the
    number automatically.
21) Control-Y toggles pause_on_screen on/off.
22) Form letters are now FILENAME.FRM or FORM####.MSG, allowing eight
    characters for more mnemonically easy form letter names. Also shows all
    available (*.frm) form letters.
23) LASTON.TXT/USER.LOG enhanced.
24) Funky colors don't look quite so funky.
25) Newuser colors are brown and cyan. No more flashing red.
26) [ and ] move down/up dirs subs (as well as +/- and </>).
27) Subname shown at read prompt.
28) Embedded colors in gfile/dir/sub/chain descriptions won't weird out
    the display in subedit/diredit, etc.
29) Some "express" commands for the longer // Sysop commands (//de for
    diredit, //be for boardedit, //ce for chainedit, //ge for gfileedit,
    //ue for uedit, //cu for chuser). The normal longer commands work
    the same as always.
30) Internal timebank for allowing users to store time for later use.
31) //resetf (reset_files()) now works at wfc with the '=' key.
32) FILE_IDZ.DIZ/DESC.SDI in archives supported for file descriptions.
33) Multiple-sysop feedback, shows sysops/cosysops with user numbers from
    1 to 9 at the feedback prompt. If only 1 sysop/cosysop found, the BBS
    works as normal (no menu selection).
34) User data written to disk for spawns, read back in upon return, for
    programs that might alter the online user's userrec data.
35) //BOARDEDIT, when editing the description, now allows deleting the
    sub description.
36) Several different dropfiles now created when CHAIN.TXT created, including
    DORINFO1.DEF, PCBOARD.SYS, DOOR.SYS, and CALLINFO.BBS.
37) All declared-but-unused vars deleted from the code.
38) International character support (¥, ¤, , etc).
39) Network dialouts show BBS name and location of board being called.
40) Logon info enhanced a bit.
41) Msg/mail headers split up so that location data is shown on a separate
    line (prevents screen overrun).
42) Local windows (done with makewindow()) now "shadowized".
43) F10 (chat) key allows selecting name-string to "chat as". Also takes
    user number.
44) For 80-column people, the sub title-scan shows who posted each message,
    as well as the title itself of course.
45) editline(), etc. now use "unsigned char", thus allowing upper ASCII chars
    for user notes, "chat as" strings, etc.
46) Newuser event now allows external ASV/CBV programs to be plugged in, and
    if these change the SL/ARs, etc. this is automatically accounted for
    upon return to WWIV.
47) Dirs and subs may now be swapped around.
48) The following optional files may be used. If they do not exist, they will
    not be printed, else they will. Their locations (when printed) are
    obvious from the filenames:

         "CHAINS"
         "XFER"
         "DOWNLOAD"
         "UPLOAD"
         "DEFAULTS"
         "GFILES"

    If these files do not exist a "file not found" message will not be
    printed.
49) Enhanced extract abilities, but you can still use the old extract
    code if OPT_OLD_EXTRACT is #define'd.
50) Non-USA callers may use freeform phones, even if that is not defined in
    INIT (this is necessary since foreign callers do not use US phone no.
    conventions).
51) Can add net subscribers to subs from mail read prompt.
52) Callers are compensated for time spent posting.
53) Subs and dirs are now conferenced. The conferencing is user-definable
    in defaults, so it can be "hidden" if the user turns conferencing off.
54) Limited multi-instance chat and messaging ability.
55) A fast binary search for files when someone uploads is available. (This
    can speed things up on some systems from several minutes to about 1 sec.)
56) Chains are definable as multiline-capable or not.
57) Extra chain ability, for who sponsored a chain. (#define'able)
58) You can get rid of the chat screecher now, with a #define.
59) SSMs on mail-delete say which network now.
60) Sysop-selectable #defines moved to bottom of VARS.H for ease.
61) Mail-list shows originating address >and< title (as much as fits).
62) Backgrave (`) may now be used in menus.
63) Simple auto-sysop validation (#define'able). Uses the Alt-F10 key
    settings, and gives exemption of 9. Prints optional ASV.ANS/.MSG
    file.
64) Multiple phone lines/instances are now supported.
65) Files may be tagged for download


AUTHORIZED BUG FIXES TO WWIV v4.23:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

As I hinted at above, there's a few bugs with 4.23 that slipped past even 
our rather extensive beta testing. The officially recognized bugs and 
fixes are as follows:

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

To fix hangup in timebank:

In misccmd.c, line # 841, change:

    c=onek("DWQ");
to:
    c=onek("QDW");


In misccmd.c, line # 881, change:

  } while (!done);
to:
  } while (!done && !hangup);

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

To fix hangup in //net:

In sysopf.c, line # 323, change:

  while (!done) {
to:
  while (!done && !hangup) {


In sysopf.c, line # 386, change:

    cmd=onek("123456789Q");
to:
    cmd=onek("Q123456789");

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

To fix possible post-out-of-order problem on gated subs:

In netsup.c, line # 1050, change:

      sprintf(fn,"%sPGATE%s",net_networks[nn].dir, nete);
to:
      sprintf(fn,"%sP1%s",net_networks[nn].dir, nete);

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

To fix removal from ALLOW.DAT (if using OPT_FAST_SEARCH):

In xfertmp.c, line #954, change:

              modify_database(s,0);
to:
              modify_database(u.filename, 0);


In xfertmp.c, line #959, change:

            modify_database(s,0);
to:
            modify_database(u.filename, 0);

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

MULTI-INSTANCE SKELETON.C?
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Some people have been asking if SKELETON.C should still be the same for multi-
instance. Since it only reads the parameter file passed to it, so as long as 
you pass it via "skeleton %1", everything is completely compatible. Any chains
which correctly read the file should not require any changes.


WWIV 4.24:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

I have now installed a generic shrinking spawn, and have finally consolidated 
all the numerous run-external-program functions and the like into one single
function, extern_prog(char *cmdline, unsigned short flags). As this is still
being debugged and expanded upon, I'm not exactly sure how much/what else 
will finally be in there yet, but there are a number of things in the works.

There may or may not be some kind of Fidonet support for this next release.
I haven't really decided yet on the matter. However, if you're interested 
in keeping up with the developments, you should contact Filo (1@2050) at
WWIV Software Services for the latest details.


SHAKE, RATTLE, & WWIV:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

For those concerned, the earthquake here in LA didn't affect me very much,
as I'm located in the southern portion of the earthquake zone. Los Angeles 
county (area code 310) is just south of area code 213 (the epicenter) and
both area codes were blocked by Pacific Bell from incoming calls during the
major period of crisis. 
So yes, I -was- cut off for a while, and I understand there were quite a
few of you wondering what would happen if something -bad- had happened to
me. I also understand Filo and H2O Doc were actually working on some sort
of contingency plan in the event @1 was "no longer in service." Maybe by
next column I'll find out what they came up with.

Oh, as for any damage, I had two flashlights fall off a shelf, and a picture
was tilted sideways slightly. However, my grandmother and someone I work 
with, had a lot of cleaning up to do afterwards, but no real permanent 
damage.


THE GREAT RENUMBERING:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

As Filo has announced on most of the Sysop subs, there will be a major node
renumbering going on in WWIVnet. Most of the details have been decided upon,
but I haven't yet specified a date for it. You will be hearing about it, 
probably in a mail-to-all-sysops, and Filo has some comments about what's 
going on later on in this issue of WWIVnews. Check out the new WWIV Software
Services column for more details.

For those curious about why the renumbering is a far more difficult matter
than it sounds, keep in mind that the WWIV/WWIVnet software is based upon 
having an unsigned short to hold node numbers. Anything other than having a
1-65530 node number would require significant re-writing of a lot of conversion
software, and would cut off anyone who hadn't upgraded to the latest versions
of WWIV and WWIVnet.

Again, Filo will have more on the details, so stay tuned.

As WWIVnews was about to go to press last week, a Los Angeles federal court 
jury hit Microsoft Corp. with $120 million in compensatory damages Wednesday
for infringement of patents for data compression products as held by Stac
Electronics. Stac, manufacturer of the on-the-fly compression utility Stacker,
filed the infringement in January 1993 over Microsoft's inclusion of the 
competitive utility Doublespace in DOS 6.0. Microsoft added Doublespace to
MS-DOS after Microsoft broke off contract negotiations with Stac over royalty
rights in November 1992.

For those watching the trial, the verdict came as a welcome surprise in light
of the courts' previous sidings with the larger manufacturer in cases such as
these. The award was viewed by most industry experts as a stunning potential 
reversal for Microsoft's dominance of the operating system market. For years,
Microsoft's rivals have complained bitterly that the company had used unfair 
tactics to squeeze out rivals in the fiercely competitive market, but only
Stac had been able to make a case out of their claims. 

The U.S. District Court jury, in the first patent infringement lawsuit against
Microsoft to ever reach trial, found Microsoft infringed two of Stac's many
patents. However, despite some evidence to the contrary, the jury did not find
that Microsoft had willfully infringed the patents, which could have resulted 
in the awarded damages being quadrupled. 

The jury made the decision following a four-week trial, which included 
testimony from both Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and Stac CEO Gary Clow. 
While some important testimony - particularly those elements involving
efforts ordered by Gates to Microsoft's attorneys to "hammer" Stac into
submitting to Microsoft's terms -  by Clow was ruled inadmissable when Clow
inadvertantly stumbled into territory that the judge ruled off-limits
during that portion of the trial, it was Gates' own testimony that was 
considered the key to Microsoft's loss.

The area of testimony that Clow stumbled into, ironically, was the actual
estimated worth of Microsoft. Clow brought this up in passing by accident
during a cross-examination by the Microsoft council on his impression of
just how important Doublespace was to MS-DOS 6.xx. At the start of the
trial, the judge presiding the case admonished both sides to avoid bringing
up Bill Gates' estimated value until the closing arguements per a request
by the Microsoft councils.

Gates, on the other hand, proved to be his own worst enemy on the witness
stand. He was repeatedly tripped up and embarassed by the Stac council 
regarding his claims - and denial of such - of the success of MS-DOS in the
industry, as well as his denial of Doublespace as being of importance to the
success of MS-DOS. Virtually all of Gates' denials were disproven by tapes of
Gates' own admissions during several promotional press conferences following
the initial release of both MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2.

In one example, Stac executives said Microsoft has shipped nearly 30 million
copies of MS-DOS 6.0. When Gates was questioned about this on the stand, he
denied that many copies had been sold, and denied any knowledge of just how
many had been sold. The Stac council asked the question again, receieved the
same answer, and then played Gates' taped annoucement for DOS 6.2, which
stated just how many estimated copies of DOS 6.0 had been sold.

The jury, in addition to the award, also found in favor of Stac on
Microsoft's counterclaims of patent infringement and breach of contract. 
Following this, Stac attorneys indicated to the judge that the company would
file for a permanent injunction barring Microsoft from shipping and from 
infringing upon Stac's data compression technology in any other manner. 
Microsoft, in turn, announced that while it will cease selling copies of DOS
6.0 and 6.2 to retailers and individuals, it will not recall copies sold prior
to the verdict.

In a conference call partially carried on CNN, Stac CEO Gary Clow stated "This
is a landmark decision with respect to software patents...this case is
a prototype for small companies, showing that they can effectively compete
with Microsoft." 

In a sort of eye-for-an-eye turnaround, though, the jury found in Microsoft's
favor on one of Microsoft's seven counterclaims for misappropriation of trade
secrets. The jury awarded Microsoft $13.6 million in damages for Stac's 
attempts to "reverse-engineer" its products to make them work with the data
compression program in MS-DOS 6.0. While the newly-released Stacker 4.0 was
announced as "backwards-compatible" with Doublespace, at press time there 
had been no requests for an injunction by Microsoft, nor were there any 
announcements from Stac with regards to a voluntary recall of this product.

Word from Microsoft insiders claim that while Microsoft founder Bill Gates
was "fit to be tied" over the jury's decision, the effects of the decision
would probably not affect Microsoft financially. The general concern was
more along the lines of how to deal with the demand for DOS without being
able to produce new copies of release 6.2 for resale. Estimates are that as
many as 2 million copies of MS-DOS 6.2 are currently in warehouses or on 
the shelves, and it is expected that these will quickly dry up from a panic 
buying spree by retailers and redistributors as public demand increases.

Some action is reportedly being taken to solve this problem. As late as Friday,
February 25th, internal memos were reportedly being circulated announcing R&D 
start on an interim release of MS-DOS 6.0 - referred to as "6.5" by number 
and "Los Angeles" by code-name - to be released by the end of April. The new
version will, of course, lack any Doublespace support.

One insider, questioned by WWIVnews briefly on the matter, stated that "this
crash program to get a new, legal version out the door is going to take away
from getting 'Chicago' and DOS 7 up and running as well. If the beta results
on 'Chicago' don't get any better soon, the release date for both could
be pushed back a good three months...which would put the release data at
around October, November at the earliest!"

[Editor's nOTE: Starting with this issue, WWIVnews will feature a column for 
WWIV Software Services. As WSS has become an integral part of WWIV and
WWIVnetting, and has become one of the major motivating forces behind keeping
WWIV and WWIVnet in line with the demands of the sysops and users, a regular 
column became as necessary as the one from Wayne Bell. Filo (WWIVnet 1@2050)
will be writing this column, and all questions regarding the material discussed
herein should be directed to Filo at that address.]

Welcome to the first WWIV Software Services column! Quite a few things to
discuss this month, so let's start off with the most important one of all,
the "Great Renumbering".


THE GREAT RENUMBERING EXPLAINED
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

I realize that to many of you, the idea of our renumbering the network comes
as a shock and you have to raise questions regarding "why" and "why now" and
"why this way?"  Those questions are all understandable.

We have known for almost 3 years (from the time that the telephone companies
originally made this decision and John Hardeman let us in on it) that this
change was coming. The knowledge was confirmed almost one year again when
Malbee posted the contents of a letter mailed to an area of New England that
notify telephone customers about it, and then more recently the Oregon area
has announced that it will use an area code with middle digit of 6 beginning
next January. Thus, the why is that the change is being "thrust" upon us from
outside and we have no control over that.

The "why now" is best answered by Wayne Bell. As I mentioned, the change has
been identified for a long time. It has been discussed at length on other
subs on at least two occassions. Wayne was adament about retaining unsigned
integers as node numbers. He did not (and does not) want to rewrite all of
the network software to support a different style of addressing. Thus, the
challenge was to develop a node numbering system that would suit our needs for
the foreseeable future, that would be relatively easy for everyone to use, and
that would permit sufficient growth in the network. There were many good
suggestions made during all of this discussion regarding what might be the
most appropriate numbering method to use within the framework of unsigned
integers and there were hundreds of suggestions that did not fit within that
framework. Anyway, the current method of numbering was finally chosen from
all of the alternatives. I think the "why now" is that "now" fits best into
Wayne's plans for the next year. If it is accomplished immediately before the
release of 4.24, then the improvements in that release will reinforce certain
changes that we are making.

The "method" of changing has been discussed much less than the renumbering
scheme itself. After some discussion, however, it was felt that running
parallel networks gave us the best opportunity to minimize problems and to
avoid losing people in the switchover.

I realize that "now" may not be the best time for each of you. I realize that
the process will be very inconvenient for all of you and that it will create
significant work on each of your parts. I am hopeful that we will all work
together to make this transition as "painless" as possible and as easy as
possible for everyone involved.


GOING FROM APPLES TO ORANGES
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Since Wayne first announced his renumbering intentions, the WWIVnet GCs 
began discussing the "how to's" of renumbering the network. The methods
decided upon were derived along these lines:

Rationale: As mentioned above, beginning in 1995 we will have USA telephone
numbers that do NOT have 0 or 1 as middle digit. Two states - Florida and 
Oregon at last word - have announced new area codes with 6 as the middle 
digit. Thus, for those area codes to participate some changes were obviously
necessary.

Because Wayne Bell wanted to keep the integer format that we use now, and 
because in anticipation of this renumbering, he worked out a method to permit
each group to have up to 1000 nodes, the following numbering system was 
developed:

4-DIGIT numbers
  Gxxx  -- where G = group number. Nodes 001 - 019 will be reserved for
           server systems. 000 will be reserved for GC.
5-DIGIT numbers
  GGxxx -- where GG = group number and same reservations as above apply.

As a consequence of this renumbering, you will NOT be able to tell area code
by looking at a node number; however, since the BBS software has the ability
to search by area code, node number, board name, etc., I do not think this
will be a problem. Somewhat contrary to my recommendations, Wayne has asked
that each GC (who may if they wish designate some work to the ACs) leave
"gaps" for growth when renumbering the group. Thus, there would be an attempt
to keep the area codes together. For a group that is as large as group 4 (380
some odd nodes at last count), the matter creates some problems.

For example, Wayne's recommendation was for a small area code using say
AC01-AC03 that room be left so that it could grow up to AC10. For larger area
codes like the Austin or Montreal area, more room would be left in the gap.


THE FIRST TEST - RENUMBERING GROUP 4
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

My problem in renumbering group 4 was that I ran out of numbers before 
getting through all of the areas. I tried renumbering the larger groups and
leaving less room for growth, but that ultimately created some problems as 
well. I can do this under our current structure, but I feel that it will only 
be a short time before all of the numbers get "mixed up" anyway. 

My initial recommendation was to split Group 4 into two groups. The new group
- let's call it group 15 - would consist of the following large area codes 
plus whatever smaller area codes might wish to join it:

     512 -- Austin area having approximately 40 boards at present
     614 -- Ohio area having approximately 25 boards
     904 -- Florida area having approximately 30 boards

This would a) reduce Group 4 by a third and still leave it as one of the
largest groups in the network, b) create a new group of 95 boards or more
which would not be the smallest group in the network, c) facilitate the
renumbering of the nodes so that "gaps" for growth could be more easily
established and maintained.

While this was being formulated, Wayne became concerned that making too many 
changes at one time would be detrimental to the process. Thus, the initial 
proposal for the Group 4 split turned out to be what will happen initially:

1)  Area Codes 512, 614, and 904 will be allowed to form Group 15
    under H2O Doc as GC for that group.
2)  The remaining boards in Group 4 will stay in Group 4 until after
    all renumbering has been accomplished. Then, the matter of a
    separate Group for the Canadian Boards and for the other Foreign
    Systems will be addressed.

As a consequence of these changes, here is the revised listing for
Group 4 as sent to Wayne:

As mentioned above, I have also recommended to Wayne that "foreign" nodes be 
assigned a special group range. The groups would be assigned according to the
numbers listed below, but still be maintained under current groups. This means
- if the suggestion is accepted - that Montreal, Mexico, and Okinawa - all 
currently in Group 4 - would be numbered as if they were outside our group,
but I would still maintain their node numbers for them until such time as each
had grown large enough to function as a separate group.

The foreign countries would be renumbered as follows:

40xxx - 49xxx  for use by foreign countries further subdivided as:

40001 - 40999 Canada
41001 - 41999 Mexico
42001 - 42999 Central & So. America (no Nodes there now)
43001 - 43999 Asia (including Japan & Okinawa where we do have boards)
44001 - 44999 Europe

"WE SHALL ACHIEVE, BEFORE THIS DECADE IS OUT..."
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

So, now that we had an idea of how things needed to be renumbered, it became
necessary to conceive a set of procedures on how this would be carried out.
In essence, the renumbering is slated to go like this:


Step 1
ÄÄÄÄÄÄ

For a short period of time, we will run "dual" networks. This one and a 
"temporary one" called WW4net.


Step 2
ÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Initial traffic on WW4net will be limited to e-mail and updates. The idea is
that we will send an update to everyone that will be the "starter" for this 
network. You will then add the new network in INIT and put your new node 
number for it. After the network has analyzed that update, you will send
an e-mail to your GC stating that you have accomplished adding the new net. 
The receipt of that e-mail will be confirmed by me. If you do not get my 
confirmation back in a reasonable time period, you should write again.


Step 3 
ÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Once all nodes or a high percentage of them have confirmed the establishment
of the new network, we will move to the next phase which will involve 
subscribing to subs on the "new" network. Once you start receiving a sub on 
the "new" network, you should drop the old one so that it will not have 
traffic on it. 

Over a short period, these procedures will "kill" the old network, subs and
all, and establish the new one. Once things seem to be functioning fully, 
Wayne will send a notice to all sysops asking them to delete the old network 
and rename WW4net to WWIVnet.

There will probably be some utilities written to facilitate various aspects of
this, but part of our desire is to minimize the amount of DEAD.NET that will
occur.


FILO'S RENUMBERING SURVIVAL GUIDE
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Now, since things are still a tad bit nebulous right now, and some people 
may still be a bit confused about what's going on and what's being planned,
I prepared this "Survival Guide" to help answer the most frequent questions
about the renumbering. The guide is in two parts - one answering the "why"
questions, the other answering the "how" questions.

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

                             GC's Survival Guide
                             for Node Renumbering
                          Part One -- March 29, 1993
                          Revised  -- January 29, 1994

Q:  Why must we renumber WWIVnet nodes?

A:  The telephone company will soon be using telephone numbers in the
    USA that do not have 1 or zero as a middle digit in the area code.
    If the node numbering scheme is not changed, those area codes will
    not be able to be a part of WWIVnet.

Q:  Why don't we use an alpha-numeric or long integer approach to node
    numbering.

A:  Basically this would require a major re-write of network and BBS
    software. The following plan should meet our current and foreseeable
    future needs.

Q:  What is the general outline of the new plan.

A:  The plan uses a GNNN or GGNNN node numbering system. Node numbers
    will initially be assigned as follows:

    Group 1 GC       :  1000
    Group 1 Servers  :  1001 -  1019
    Group 1 Nodes    :  1021 -  1999

    Group 2 GC       :  2000
    Group 2 Servers  :  2001 -  2019
    Group 2 Nodes    :  2020 -  2999

    ...
    Group 10 GC      : 10000
    Group 10 Servers : 10001 - 10019
    Group 10 Nodes   : 10020 - 10999

    Group 11 GC      : 11000
    Group 11 Servers : 11001 - 11019
    Group 11 Nodes   : 11020 - 11999

    ...

    Group 65 GC        65000
    Group 65 Servers : 65001 - 65019
    Group 65 Nodes   : 65020 - 65534

    Node 65535  reserved


    In other words, the first node G000 of each group is reserved for
    the GC of the group. The next 19 nodes are reserved for
    server systems. The remaining node numbers are for node assignments.
    This allows us to have 64 groups of 999 nodes each. Nodes with
    3 digits are less will be reserved for charter systems and/or very
    special purposes. Group 65 will be a smaller group due to the
    limitation of the maximum short integer.

Q:  How does this new node numbering plan affect network administration?
    That is, will there still be group and area coordinators?

A:  Yes, the network will continue to have a 3-tiered administration:
    Net Coordinator, Group Coordinators, Area Coordinators.

    Area Coordinators will still be defined by area code, even though
    their node number does not reflect their area code.

Q:  How will the new node numbers be assigned?

A:  The GCs, perhaps with assistance from their ACs, will assign node
    numbers within their block of numbers. It is recommended that the
    numbers be assigned sequentially with some unassigned node numbers
    (UNNs) built into the sequencing in order to facilitate node number
    assignments by ACs as growth occurs.

    For example, let us say that Group 1 has the following area codes
    and nodes within it to begin with:

    Area Code      Number of Nodes
      301            30
      407            45
      519            32

    Node numbers should be assigned sequentially with ten or more (round
    to the next highest 10) UNNs per area code. For example:

     Area Code     Node Numbers Assigned   Unassigned for AC use
       301         1020-1050               1051-1059
       407         1060-1105               1105-1119
       519         1120-1152               1152-1169

     Once an area coordinator has used up the original 10+ UNNs assigned
     initially, then the GC should assign that AC an additional 10 UNNs
     to work with. For example, let us say that area code 407 used up
     the UNNs assigned to it originally (1105-1119) and needed more
     numbers; then the GC would assign the next 10 unused numbers (1170-1179)
     for use.

     The GC should NOT attempt to develop a structure that would always
     keep a block of numbers available for an area as eventually that
     method would break down.

Q:   When should the GC begin to make new node number assignments?

A:   The GC may do this at any time; HOWEVER, the new assignments will
     NOT BE EFFECTIVE until a future (as yet undesignated) date. We
     plan to develop software which will take all node assignments in
     files such as SUBS.XTR, DEAD.NET, Sxxx.NET, Zxxxx.NET, Nxxxx.NET,
     and the headers for messages, and convert that information to
     the new format. If we are successful in this, then we will have
     a method to convert all existing data to the new format with a
     minimum of trouble for the sysops of the network and with a
     minimum loss of information and messages.

     It is essential that no one use the new numbers until the
     designated time for conversion and that everyone try to convert
     at or near the same time. This conversion will be discussed and
     coordinated long before it is scheduled to take place.

Q:   What should be done with "fake nodes" in the 5xx and 6xx series?

A:   These nodes should be assigned regular node numbers within the
     normal sequence for each group; however, these will still be
     handled specially by the coordinators of those respective
     gateways. This may necessitate closer communication between each
     of those gateway coordinators and the respective GCs.

Q:  What should be done with the "charter" nodes (ie those with node
    numbers between 1 and 25)?

A:  Those nodes will retain their charter number just as they do
    currently.

Q:  How will the renumbering affect subtypes?

A:  In order to avoid any more confusion than is absolutely necessary,
    if you host a sub, you should NOT attempt to change sub numbers
    immediately. And in fact, if you are using subtype by numbers
    now, you can continue using those.

    Any new Subs added to the net after the new node numbering goes
    into effect MUST BE subs-by-name.

                        Part Two -- Creating a New NET

The basic procedure here will be to create a new parallel NetWork called
WW4NET. This network will be for E-Mail and NET UPDATES ONLY at first so
that we can get everyone connected and working at a minimum cost to everyone.
Many thanks to H20 Doc of 5284 for the suggestions.

Note: People running versions prior to 4.21a will NOT be able to use
      this approach. Since such older versions of WWIV will become in-
      increasingly outdated, people are urged to upgrade to newer versions
      as soon as possible.0


PHASE ONE
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

The purpose of this phase is to get a new network set of data files in place
and to insure that everyone is receiving. No one should start any new subs
during this process until all phases are completed.


Step One
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   GC's and AC's will develop the new node assignments, informing both 1@1
   and the individual nodes what the new node numbers are.

Step Two
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   Each Sysop is requested to:
      (a) use INIT option N to create a new network called WW4NET with
          its own separate network directory.
      (b) Each Sysop should enter the new node number for WW4NET in
          INIT with option N


Step Three
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

    The new BBSLIST.* and CONNECT.* files will be distributed to all
    network members. The actual method of this distribution will be
    announced by the GC's. It might be a UUencoded distribution from
    @1 similar to the distribution of the new DE1.EXE last July, or
    it might be via uploads/downloads in a cooperative fashion throughout
    the network.


STEP Four
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

    The Sysop must then create a CALLOUT.NET file in the WW4NET directory.
    Run network3 Y on it to insure that it analyzes properly.

Step Five
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

    Each GC will send out Source Verified Mail to each group member. The
    group member should respond to this mail so that the GC can tell which
    nodes are "successfully converted."

    This will end phase one and it should not take more than 2 weeks at the
    most. WW4NET traffic during this time should be limited to e-mails
    from GC's; replies from nodes, and updates if any.


PHASE TWO
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

The purpose of this phase is the conversion of Subscriber lists and Host
info. People who have been using numeric subtypes may continue to do so;
however do NOT change numeric subtypes to another number!  Any new subtypes
to be added after the network is converted or any subtype changes should all
be SUB-BY-NAME.

Step One
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

    All Hosts should notify their subscribers on the old network of what
    their new NODE NUMBER will BE. Subscribers can now enter this info
    into their boardedit such that each sub will show on both networks.

    The subscriber should send auto-subscription or e-mail on the new
    network requesting each sub that he wishes. As soon as the subscriber
    gets confirmation from the host, he may drop that sub off of OLD NET
    and be receiving it on the new net.

    The host should promptly ADD nodes to the new network and DROP them
    from the old network in order to facilitate this process.


Step Two
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   Once the host feels that there are no more subscribers in old net,
   and/or that all conversions that are going to occur have actually
   occured, the old sub may be killed.

   Eventually there will be little or no traffic on the Old Net.


Step Three
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   At some point and hopefully no longer than one month after we
   start this process, 1@1 will instruct everyone to delete all
   the old BBSLIST.*, CONNECT.*, CALLOUT.net, FBACKHDR.net,
   contact.*, etc., from their old directory (the data directory).


Step Four
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   Remove WWIVnet from the INIT.


Step Five
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   Rename WW4NET to WWIVnet in INIT but leave the path to the now
   renamed WW4NET unchanged in INIT.

   One advantage of this process is that the network oriented files in
   DATA (if WWIVnet is setup there) will be removed to another directory
   that is network specific. This will make backing up certain crucial
   data files in DATA easier.


Step Six
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

   Shortly after the instructions above have been issued from @1, a
   "ping" will be sent out by him to generate a new SUBS.LST for the
   network.

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

So, as you can see, the "Great Renumbering" is not a simple process, but
it's not *that* complex. I'll be posting more on the progress of this project
on the Sysop subs, and a complete update will be in the next issue of WWIVnews
as well.

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

GETTING THE BUGS OUT OF WWIV
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Some of you have been asking about the debugging procedures that the beta
testers for WWIV go through. To give you an idea of how it works, I kept a
running list of bugs, and posted it daily on the BETA sub, where all BETA
testors have access, and on the WWIV_DEV sub, where just the developers
have access.

The list for 4.23 looked pretty much like this about two weeks prior to 
the release of 4.23:

*  = Deferred until 4.24
** = Can anyone replicate this error?


The Person column is for the person who is assigned to fix or check out the 
bug. Status 0 means unfixed so far; status 1 means it has been fixed. The 
short name is just something I give it for reference.  The Reference column 
refers to who posted the problem on the BETA sub in case the person assigned 
responsibility for "fixing" it needs more detail.

Some, like #4, are not really bugs but serve as reminders that something
needs to be done (update help.msg) before the official release to public.
Some, like #16, are such that the development team (and others) have
been unable to replicate the error...and so we cannot be sure that it is an
actual error.

I keep a directory also for suggested changes in the docs. Although I have 
rewritten the docs entirely, as with any set of documentation there are some
errors and omissions that manage to creep in, and some points where things 
are just not clear enough.

I really believe that this release is the most thouroughly tested, most 
completely documented, new release that WWIV has ever experienced. I feel
that it reflected a new level of professionalism that is possible through 
use of a team of programmers and a team of BETA testers. The product, of
course, speaks for itself.

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

FUTURE PROJECTS FOR WWIV
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

WWIV Software Services is working with someone on an OS/2 port, and we hope to
have a product released around mid summer to early fall. The price for this
port is projected to be $100 for pre-compiled versions and $125 for source 
versions. Unlike the DOS version, WWIV for OS/2 will NOT be available in 
shareware versions. Persons with v4.xx registrations may "trade up" by paying
the difference between what they originally paid ($50 or $80) and the price of
the OS/2 version.

We also have a "WWIVLite" in the works. No release date has been set, but the
intent is to have something that a person could run sort of like a point.node 
on the network without running a full-scale BBS.

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

That's all for this month! If you have any questions, they should be directed
to WWIVnet 1@2050.

...Wow, since our last issue, it seems that everyone decided to sue everyone
else. Let's see how the scorecard went, eh?

...In case you skipped over it, go back and read the article on the Stac vs
Microsoft trial. The verdict has a lot more impact on the industry than the
news media has been letting on. For starters, it's a heralding sign to the
major industry leaders that the courts aren't going to let you walk all
over the smaller guys any way you please. At the same time, it's a sure sign
to everyone that while it's perfectly fine to get rich at what you do, don't 
go out of your way to sabotage or steal from your competition with abandon,
especially if you can't do the job right yourself in the first place!

...The WWIVnews Staff has been raising several toasts to Stac and its CEO, 
Gary Clow, since the verdict was announced, and in an admitted fit of biasness
our congratulations go to the Stac staff. At the same time, the traditional
Brooklyn salute & Bronx cheer go to Bill Gates and all the "hammerers" at
Microsoft - the only "hammering" that was done was to the nails in the coffin
of their case!

...From the "Look deeply into my eye, Bill!" department: As mentioned earlier
in this issue, Stac Electronics has announced Stacker 4.0 for Windows and DOS.
Stac claims that Stacker 4.0 offers compression ratios of better than 2:1,
with the average being improved to 2.8:1 in most cases. The new version also
includes a new Stacker Windows Toolbox, which offers a toolbar with the
various Stacker commands available at the click of the mouse. The product also
offers both audio and visual cues can now alert users to how fragmented the 
disk has become or how much free space is available. 

...While the program requires the same amount of memory space, it now takes 
up less of the critical memory space below the one megabyte (MB) level,
freeing up memory needed by many software applications. By incorporating
Novell's DOS Protected Mode Service (DPMS), Stacker now needs 17 kilobytes
(KB) below 1MB, while the Stacker device driver is moved to extended memory
and executed in protected mode on 386 and 486 computers. According to Stac, 
protected mode execution has the added benefit of making the Stacker device 
driver less susceptible to interference from other applications - read: 
certain graphic-intensive games, and anything from Microsoft. 

...The product also offers an Autosave feature, maintaining a duplicate set 
of both the DOS and Stacker file system information in an uncompressed state.
There is some controversy as to how much good this does, because in a crisis 
the question arises as to which file to use, the original or the duplicate. 
However, Stacker officials maintain that if anything, the duplicate files 
offer an added degree of confidence. 

...at press time, Stacker 4.0 was reportedly compatible with MS-DOS v3.2 
through v6.2, and with Novell's DOS - DR-DOS to the rest of us - through 
v7.0. This meaning that 4.0 can replace Doublespace or IBM's Superstor/DS
compression. While there's no concern where Superstor/DS is concerned - 
after all, Addstor is now out of business - it remains to be seen whether
Microsoft will seek an injunction against Stac over Stacker 4.0's backwards
compatibility with Doublespace.

...Stacker 4.0 for Windows & DOS has an MSRP of $149, but previous users may 
upgrade for $49.95. Street prices have already been seen as low as $99,
with the upgrade going for $39.95.

...Speaking of lawsuits, from the "Gee, I wish Intel would lose their ass so 
I could afford a 486!" department: By now, most of you know that Intel was 
forced into conceding a $10 million out of court settlement to Cyrix over the
rights to produce and market CPU's using Intel's 80x86-based microcode. What 
many of you may not be aware of is that demand for the Cyrix Cx486DRx2 386 
upgrade processors shot through the roof the day after the settlement was 
reached.

...Cyrix claims these chips will breath new life into 386DX systems by using
a pop-and-drop replacement for the original processor. These chips use the
same internal clock doubling concept as the DX/2 series - operating at roughly
twice the speed of the external clock - but due to limitations in the 16-bit
bus structures most older 386's implemented, the average speed increase over
the original processor is only about 70% on the average.

...Right now, these chips exist as replacements for the 16, 20 and 25MHz
versions of the 386DX. Support for 386SX chips is expected sometime in 3Q '94,
although there are no plans to support the 386SL in the forseeable future.
Since most 386SL's were surface mounted to their motherboards, pop-and-drop
replacement is not a viable option, and what few weren't isn't enough to
justify the expense of manufacturing the replacements. 

...If you know what you're doing, installation of the DRx2's is relatively
simple. Simply pop the top off your computer, remove the 386 processor - most
dealers sell the DRx2 with a removal tool - and pop the new chip into place. 
As these chips do run a little hot, Cyrix has included a small self-stick heat
sink to stick on the top. You need to run a software utility to enable the 
internal 1K cache, but like Cardinal's DMS activator it unloads after it's
finished and there is no RAM loss.

...The MSRP for the 16/32MHz version is $299, the 20/40 and 25/50 versions are
priced at $349 and $399 respectively. The street price for the 16/32, though,
has been seen as low as $189 mail-order, while the 20/40 has leveled off to
around $299. The 25/50, however, has remained pretty close to MSRP as demand
is high and quantities are low. A 33MHz version is also reportedly in some
stage of development, but is not expected to see production anytime in 1994. 
Industry experts suspect this has to do with the still-high demand for AMD's 
386DX-40, and Cyrix would rather milk the "gee, I've got this old, still 
really good but *slow* motherboard..." market. Based on the production levels
for the 16/32 and 20/40 chips, this may well be a very accurate assessment!

...On a side note from the Caveat your Emptor department: Be aware that there
are reports left and right that are somewhat negative regarding the DRx2
upgrades and compatibility with OS/2. Reports are that OS/2 1.3 or below
won't even boot, and that 2.0 and 2.1 have problems where none existed with
the previous processor. No official comment has been made by either Cyrix
or IBM regarding these reports, although one late-breaking report to WWIVnews
stated that both Windows NT and the beta for "Chicago" won't run properly
on the DRx2's either.

...Bottom line on these chips appear to be this: if you've got a 16 or 20MHz
board that's still behaving itself, and the price is right, these chips might
be the way to do a quick upgrade on a system without doing a complete CPU
and motherboard replacement. However, the 25/50 version is nowhere near
cost effective. A good VLB motherboard will run you about $139, while an
AMD DX-40 will run you about $289 if you shop around. That's only about
50 bucks more than the 25/50 replacement, and you'll be getting VESA Local
Bus slots to boot!

...Of course, there's the third-party 286 upgrade modules to consider, but
we'll save that for a later techNOTEs, eh? Besides, by that time Intel vs
AMD should be a settled issue as well.

...Speaking of Intel, IBM insiders have informed WWIVnews that Big Blue has
informed the maker of the Pentium that in no uncertain terms the next major
line of IBM-manufactured PCs will all be using the PowerPC 601 and 603
as the CPU. After testing the 60MHz and 66MHz versions of the renamed P5,
the chip was found wanting when compared to the PowerPC. Thus, "Thanks, but
no thanks" was the final reported decision on the Pentium. 

...This is another blow for Intel, as per the contract agreement between the
two companies over chip development, IBM had the option of either using the
Pentium for a really *low* royalty, or having Intel *purchase* IBM's
low royalty rights for a seriouly high sum! WWIVnews' advice: buy Motorola
stock. A *lot* of it.

...From the "Berkeley Brethed is *still* a stupid name Department: A lawsuit
filed by Berkeley Systems in a San Francisco Federal Court claimed that a
new screen saver from Delrina Corp. violates Berkeley' "Flying Toasters" 
screen saver software copyright. That lawsuit was recently awarded in favor
of Berkeley Systems, and has forced Delrina to rework the screen saver to 
eliminate the copyright offense.

...The screen that caused all the ruckus was the one that shows Opus, the 
penguin created by Pulitzer Prize winning cartoonist Berkeley Breathed for the 
gone-but-better-return-SOON-whether-he-wants-to-do-it-or-not comic strip 
"Bloom County", shooting down a flock of flying toasters, which then return 
fire with burnt toast. The changes to this screen involved changing the shape
of the toasters, and replacing their wings with a helicopter rotor.

...From the Legal Eagles Statue Droppings department: Speaking of Lotus,
remember when Lotus won their "look and feel" lawsuit against Borland over 
Quattro Pro's compatibility macro for 1-2-3? Well, in an additional slap in 
the face of the retail industry, a federal judge recently ruled that resellers
must immediately stop selling copies Quattro Pro which infringes on Lotus 
development's copyright. 

...For those taking notes of such things, the list of affected products include
practically the entire line of Quattro versions! Quattro, Quattro Pro 1.0, 2.0,
3.0, 4.0, 4.01, and SE are all on the list of things you can't sell. Borland
is producing a new version which does not infringe on Lotus copyrights, and
version 5.0, will ship by the time you read this.

...Of course, what makes this matter far more idiotic is that the judge's
ruling effectively infringes upon free trade. When Apple won their suit 
against Digital Research over the Gem desktop environment, Apple asked that
the judge in that case also issue rulings to force retailers to quit selling
that product. The judge told Apple to basically get stuffed, as that would
be punishing retailers for transgressions the product manufacturer was found
guilty of, and it would be like punishing the child for the sins of the
father!

...Keep an eye on this one, folks. There's grounds for a serious restitution
suit by the major retailers here, whether it be against Borland or Lotus, or 
both!

...From the "My School Box" department: Before enrolling in college, TechnOTES
advises you to check and see whether or not you're going to need to buy some
sort of laptop. With computer prices dropping for x386-based systems - read:
Windows-capable - more and more colleges have started including lightweight 
notebooks on the "required" school supply list. Courses are also becoming
more tailored towards computer assistance, with professors being urged to
make their lecture notes available on disk for ease of access and data
enhancement.

...Some colleges and universities have gone one step further in making 
portable computers mandantory. Depending on the degree, students attending 
Hartwick College, University of Minnesota, Bentley and Nichols Colleges, and 
Drew University must own or rent an IBM-compatible laptop with at least a
386 processor or better. Other universities, such as Texas University, Notre
Dame and Miami(Fla) have begun investigating such requirements, although
the word is that these three major institutions are leaning towards Apple's
Powerbooks, with the possibility of requiring Newtons when the new PDA
becomes more readily available.

...From the "Why Johnny Can't Hack" department: Looking to dump that old
PC that'll cost more to upgrade than to buy a new one? Call Computers-4-Kids
at (203) 754-5560, They'll take your old PC for use in schools where the
local taxpayers are too cheap to maintain the quality of technical 
education to acceptable levels. If you're a bit queasy about giving away
something you probably paid a couple grand for, keep in mind that 
donations such as these are tax-deductable!

...From the "Internet Meets Pete Townsend's 'Tommy'" Department: CMP 
Publications, publishers of Network Computing and Communications Week, has 
launched a newsletter for corporate strategists interested in using the 
Internet as a channel for information products and services and/or as a means 
of extending support for current operations. In light of the success of
Clarinet - and despite their horrendously overpriced surcharges - it's
expected that perhaps 30% of Internet will be accessable through commercial
services by the end of 1995, and that by the end of the decade the 'net and/or
its "electronic highway" successor will be nothing *but* one big commercial
service battleground.

...first salvo in this war for your Internet dollars is the Internet
Business Review. The IBR is published monthly in an 8-page hardcopy format,
and a complimentary sample issue can be had simply by sending Internet E-Mail
to ibr@cmp.com. Be sure to put "free copy" in the subject line, eh?

...Thinking about buying a Floptical? Well, hold on to your horses for a 
bit, because things are about to shake up on that market. Eight of the
major movers and shakers in the still-looking-for-acceptance Floptical market,
including #1-seller IOmega, are meeting in March to define a new Floptical
standard. The preliminary work has already been done, and the promise is a
new breed of Floptical that can store up to 100MB on a single disk, with the
initial cost not to exceed the current costs for a complete Floptical setup!

...Floptical drives are nice. They're fast, backwards-compatible with regular
1.44MB floppies, and can actually be used as a small, slow hard drive in
a tight situation. However, despite the fact that the 20MB disks are perfect
for those of us still stuck in floppy mode for backups or sneakernets, the
cost per disk still seems restrictive, not to mention the cost per drive.
Hence the Flopticals have only sold about 75,000 units among all the companies
that are producing them, and less than 200,000 Floptical disks total.

...So, while it's still a niche product that needs a bigger niche, the
new standards will give the initial setup costs a bigger bang for the buck
in the long run. After all, for $20-$25 for 100MB of storage - removable
at that - the $400 per drive will be a bit more acceptable by the masses.
If drive prices also drop as result of the new standards, all the better.

...Remember a few issues back where TechnOTES discussed Bill Gates' plans for
the "Windows Kitchen"? Well, Intel Corp. has decided they can take the heat
as well. Intel's own recipie calls for a low-cost embedded version of a 386-SX
to act as the "brains" for various kitchen appliances. Home entertainment and
phone services are also expected to benefit from the specialized chips, and
Intel has already begun soliciting designs in hopes of attracting interest 
from the telecommunications and cable-TV industries.

...Plans also call for the chips to appear in the workplace, as controllers 
for smart office equipment, such as air conditioners, printers, copiers, fax
machines and cellular phones. The first of these implementations is expected
to be marketed near the end of 4Q '94.

...Intel hasn't forgotten the 586..er..P5...er..Pentium. Plans are underway
to build Pentium Overdrive processors for release in the third quarter '94.
The Overdrive Processor concept, introduced for Intel's 486 chip line last 
year, are - in most cases - customer-upgradeable processors with which, users
can either replace the existing CPU, or insert into a socket originally 
reserved for the 80487 math coprocessor.

...For those still confused about all these overdriving upgrades, these 
particular chips are different from the DX2 CPUs which are designed for OEMs
to install into existing system motherboards. Both the Overdrive and DX2 chips
have the same objective, which is faster performance by doubling the clock 
speed of the CPU they replace. The end result allows users and OEMs alike to 
get a boost in performance without expensive system redesign or motherboard
replacements.

...Of course, these chips will not be available until supplies of the Pentium 
itself can be supplied to meet the demand. Pentiums will be limited in 
availability until Intel's planned production ramp-up occurs in 2ndQ '94.
Pentium Overdrive chips will see production once supplies of the base Pentium
meet the demand.

...From the "Hey, sumbody stole yo' bat'try!" Department: Honda is now 
offering an in-dash cellular phone kit. When a call is received, the phone 
mutes the car's stereo system and the phone can be answered automatically.
Other options include an answering machine feature and programmable speed 
dialing, and Honda is reportedly doing R&D into a cellular modem function
for this unit as well.
 
...Most importantly, if the car is stolen, the phone automatically calls home!
If the CelModem becomes an option, you can have it send you MCIMail as well!

...From the "If you can't sell it, give it away! department: Last July, Novell
acquired Unix Systems Laboratories from AT&T. In what some people see as either
a bold move or a sign of defeat, Novell has announced it will give the Unix 
trademark away, free and clear to the public domain.

...Claiming that it wants to unify the Unix community, Novell will render the
Unix trademark - and possibly the command structure itself - unto public
domain, where all the various flavors of Unix can finally combine into one
cross-portable taste. Until this announcement, most of the differences between
the various versions of Unix were forced upon the respective companies due to
AT&T's rather stringent royalty requirements.

...While many Unix enthusiasts see this as the first positive step in years 
towards unification, which will help bringing Unix into the forefront of the 
operating system wars, the majority of industry experts agree that this is 
nothing more than Novell saying "hey, we can't sell it, might as well give
it away!", and is in effect simply the first real nail in Unix' coffin. Lord
knows all the DOS/Windows and OS/2 users are saying the same thing!

...From the "Stick a Joystick in his mouth!" Department: Nintendo Inc. is 
conducting a major study on epilepsy in relation to television game activities.
The study comes on the heels of recent reports on the problems of epileptic 
children who played Nintendo's "Super Famicom" and the "Family Computer" - 
what's known as the NES System outside Japan. At least four dozen cases have
been reported of children suffering epileptic seizures while playing TV games,
with the cause believed to be what's called "optic induced epilepsy." This 
particular form of epilepsy is said to be caused by rapidly flashing lights,
usuallt in the red or orange range of the spectrum. In the case of the NES,
the flickering lights associated with certain game effects have been measured
to flash at rates normally associated with those that trigger seizures.

...Nintendo, as well as other major Japanese game makers have already performed
research the possible epileptic problem. Other game firms such as Sega and NEC
Home Electronics may join Nintendo in the research, although some independent 
medical researchers in Japan have shown some skepticism about the relationship 
between TV games and epilepsy. These researchers claim that statistics already
show that no such link exists.

...According to the National Rehabilitation Hospital of Japan, there are about
one million epileptic patients in Japan alone. Among these people, only 30,000
people have been diagnosed as optic induced epileptic patients, and none of
them can be specifically linked to a TV-induced attack. The problem can be 
prevented with oral medicine, but patients are still encouraged to avoid
staring into rapidly flashing lights.

...From the "Govorit Po-IBMiski?" Department: Apple and IBM moved closer 
towards closing the interoperability gap between their platforms with Apple's
introduction of an application that allows its Macintoshes to work on 
IBM-based networks. Apple's SNA.ps 5250 emulation software package enables the
Macintosh to behave like IBM terminals and access thousands of applications 
available on IBM's AS/400 systems. 

...While most Mac enthusiasts question the logic behind emulating what most
industry experts consider IBM's biggest boondoggle since the PCjr, quite a
few inquiries from AS/400 MIS' have been reported by Apple reps since the 
package went on sale in June '93. The $345 MSPR package is the first joint
sales venture for both Apple and IBM.

...From the Dick Tracy Department: Motorola has announced plans to introduce
a card-size version of its NewsStream Advanced Information Reciever. The 
NewsCard is aimed at use in PCs, palmtops and PDAs, and is due out later this
year. In a related move, AT&T connected its EasyLink Services E-Mail to 
Motorola's Embarc wireless delivery service. This allows AT&T Mail users to 
send E-Mail to recipients using portable computers in more that 200 cities.
Both moves are expected to benefit the wireless information gathering features
of the next generation of PDAs.

...From the Arteest department: Corel has acquired the entire Ventura line of
products. This includes Ventura Publisher, Ventura Database Publisher, and
related all technologies. Plans are reported to be along the lines of
combining all products with Corel Draw and release a major desktop publishing
office suite sometime in 4Q '94. 

...Corel is now shipping Corel Ventura 4.2 for Windows. This includes two 
CD-ROMs with over 600 fonts, 10,000 EPS clip-art images, and 100 Kodak PhotoCD
photos. MSRP is $249, although some softwarehouses have reportedly been 
selling it for $199.

...For those who've had to use Ventura Publisher in lieu of Pagemaker, the 
general hope is that Corel will simply work all the quirks out of VP and make 
it a viable Windows product for once!

...From the "Why *should* I upgrade?" department: Did you know that Novell has
not still upgraded to release 4.01 of NetWare internally? Did you also know
that they have no absolutely *no* immediate plans to do so? Hey guys, at least
Microsoft had the guts to upgrade to Windows for Workgroups with the first
release, so what does that tell you about Novell 4.01?

...From the "TANSTAAFL" department: Word from that great Mormon state is that
WordPerfect is abandoning the 1-800 technical support line. Citing the 
various runaround reasons every other company has given for switching to
1-900 support lines, the bottom line through all the hype appears to be this:
If Microsoft can get away with charging an average of $12 a call, then 
WordPerfect 6.0 should average about twice that based on how buggy the 
code is!

...Speaking of WordPerfect, did anyone happen to catch the significance of
the 6.0 release for DOS? That's right, it won't work on an XT no matter
how much XMS that RAMpage has on it! You have to have a 286 or better to
even *boot* the mess!

...In short, folks, WordPerfect has driven the final nail in the XT's
coffin. Let's have a moment of silence for the 8088, shall we? It served
us well all those years, and now it's time to put it to rest. That is, of
course, unless you're still enamored with using Wordstar 4.0!

...From the Hard Copy department: Hewlett-Packard and Time Warner are 
reportedly working together to develop technologies that would allow a cable
customer to plug a color printer into the cable converter box, and print out 
sales coupons, ads, magazine articles and color stills of TV shows. The first
testing ground will be Time Warner's planned interactive TV experiment in
Orlando, Fla., where 4,000 cable customers will be equipped with H-P color
ink-jet printers. 

...While the QVC support stuff might be effective, one has to wonder how
Hollywood is going to react to such an innovation. After all, if you can
simply plug in a Deskjet and grab a shot of anything on the screen, there's
going to be agents running amok trying to figure out how to secure royalties
for each printed image! And you thought the $1 surcharge on blank tapes was
simply greed in action!

...On a side note, no word yet whether the B&W Deskjets or any of the HP
Laserjet series will be supported by this new cable system.

 ...From the Greener Pastures & their products department: In an effort to
get in on the "Green PC" bandwagon, several suppliers have started offering
a new series of mousepads.  Get this, folks - Rainforest pads. These mousepads
are decorated with color photos of actual, still-alive rainforests and the
various fauna and flora that live there. 

...Of course, this isn't just art for art's sake. Included with each mousepad
is a free educational booklet which is supposed to help heighten awareness of 
rainforest conservation. Based on current consumer apathy towards the "Save
the Forests by wiping your ass with your hands!" crowd, rest assured that
anyone buying these pads will no doubt file this manual with the rest of
those hardware manuals we're forever losing!

...While we're greening our PC's here, Technology Marketing Partners has 
something called the MonitorMiser. This litte $79.95 doo-da hooks in between
your monitor and the power cord, and powers the monitor down after a 
specified amount of idle time. Since most energy savings occur at the 
monitor level, if you're *really* into this "Green PC" fad but don't want
to spend a lot on a new, "Energy Star" compliant machine, then this might
be the way to split the difference.

...To carry this one step further, has anyone caught AST Research's ad for
their "Green PC"? The one that's got the monitor and pizza box painted
a fluorecent forest green? Well, word from an AST rep who *demanded* to
remain anonymous says that a certain government agency that's responsible
for pushing the "Energy Star" program has inquired with AST about buying
some *two thousand* of these gaudy little baubles. And you thought the
Clinton Administration was going to cut waste and frivolty, didn't you?

...Of course, the most logical next step in the "Green PC" movement would
be for someone to start developing solar powered portables. After all, at
least 80% of the hand-held calculators manufactured in the past 2 years
have been small models with solar cells running them. Granted, it took 
almost 15 years for that to become the standard for calculator power, but
in the end the chipsets are more efficient in both power and speed. If
TI could go from a desktop model with a 20lb external power supply to a 
5.5oz handheld with twice as many functions within that time, imaging how
quickly we could bring PCs down to near that level seeing as how we sort of
already know how to do it?

...Well, Zenith Data Systems is reportedly working on such a beast now.
While their yet-unnamed prototype is still a good two years away from an
actual production run, the unit uses solar power to extend the life of
current battery packs from 3 hours to at least 15 hours depending on use.
Don't expect this one to be cheap, folks: prices for the solar cell banks
alone totals up to just under $1000 at current market prices, and those
aren't expected to change anytime this decade based on current market
speculation!

...From the Full Metal Jacket department: Anyone here tried OS/2 For Windows
yet? Reports from everyone who's used this product and done side-by-side
comparisons with regular OS/2 2.1 say that "Ferengi" not only is a far more
stable combination than the normal OS/2 package, but that it actually runs
about 10% faster, especially when you migrate apps to the OS/2 desktop!

...Of course, releasing a streamlined version of OS/2 had more initiative
from Microsoft than anything else. Seems that Big Blue was having to pay
the Gates boys $30 a copy in royalties for each copy of normal OS/2 sold, 
per the agreement that allowed the use of Win31 source for the Win-OS/2
shell & migrator. In what has to be the best marketing strategy IBM's done
to date - if not the best for 1993 *period* - IBM in one fell swoop clipped
the need to pay Bill Gates one red cent out of any OS/2 profits, and managed
to do so without raising the cost of the product! Word from inside Microsoft
is that Gates was broken the news about Ferengi on his *honeymoon*, which
probably didn't help matters too much with the nuptuals :-)

...On a side note, the running jokes around Microsoft - one real, the other
we're not sure of - regarding Gates' departure from batchelorhood, go 
something like this:

"Bill Gates got married to one of his employees on a friday. The following
monday, Mrs. Gates called in to tell her supervisor that she'd be late for
work for a while..."

"Mrs. Gates had two words to describe her honeymoon with husband Bill. Those
words were 'Micro' and 'Soft'..."

...From the "Sounds like Blaster Spirit" department: Word from inside printer
giant Hewlett-Packard is that the company is about to make a major plunge 
into the sound card market. Two cards are reportedly under development for a
late '94 release. A 16-bit sound card which will sell for about $150 should
hit the stores in time for the holidays, while a 32-bit professional MIDI
card will follow shortly after with an MSRP of around $349.

...From the "Rotten to the Core" department: Apple's in-house BBS is reportedly
offering an online course called "Life After Layoffs". There's a catch to 
getting access, though: you have to be unemployed to take it!

...From the Unsung Heroes department: One of the unmentioned innovations from
Comdex Fall '94 was a product called "DIP to SIMM". This a little circuit
board with DIP sockets for nine DIPs, and plugs into a SIMM socket. As most
oldtimers know, a *lot* of older motherboards used DIPs - many of them in the
acceptable 80ns range - and would still be good if you had a way to use them
when you upgraded to a new motherboard that uses SIMMs.  This here's a way to
keep those memory chips and save some money.

...The cards are produced by a company called Autotime, and retail for $8.50.
If you don't trust sockets, you can send your chips to the company and they'll
solder them for you for an additional $13.50. Like the ZSIMMs that came out
of Austin back in '92, the reborn SIMM is significantly taller than a regular
SIMM module, so you'll need to check whether the increased height will 
interfere with any cards, the power supply, or whatever.

...Caveat Emptor: Don't try this with DIPs that are below 80ns unless your
motherboard can handle slower SIMM speeds. Quite a few motherboards refuse
to run SIMMS at speeds below 80ns, and some - particularly those produced
by CAF and CMOS - refuse to run anything below *70ns*!

...From the "Mazda's gonna *sue*!!!!" department: Intel is preparing to ship
their first software product, code-named Miata, in the first half of 1994.
Miata is reportedly an interactive file-sharing Windows application that lets
two users view the same file over a modem connection, and contains tools that
let users annotate a document or spreadsheet being discussed. A "chalkboard"
mode lets users jot notes that can be seen by both viewers. A utility known 
as Jump Start will reportedly let Miata users show files to users who lack
the full version of the software.

...Beta testers have already been sent the first version of the product, and
have been told to expect to see support for voice and data communications via
the same connection provided both users are using an Intel digital modem.
Predicted MSRP for this product is $249, although reports are that the product
may be bundled in a "lite" version with a new Intel digital modem slated for
a 3Q '94 release.

...Finally, from the "Service with a Smile" department: Anyone bought a Boca
14.4 Bocamodem lately? WWIVnews suggests that you check out the BIOS revision
to make sure that it's not v1.21. Boca shipped out a large shipment of that
particular modem with a buggy BIOS that wouldn't connect to anything above
2400bd! While Boca will replace the modem if you ship it in, according to 
several technicians it took calls to the Vice President of the company to 
finally get someone to admit that a bad batch *did* exist!

WWIV SysOps are constantly looking for external programs to add to their BBS
to make them more useful, colorful, or more enjoyable for their users. This is
not an easy task. It can also be get quite expensive when the program you want
and need is a LD call away.

With so many programs out there it's hard to know what's good and what's junk.
Luckily for you, I have found a group of programmers who are dedicated to
creating new and exciting programs for WWIV SysOps and users. 

The group is Datagen Software Designs, and is headed by it's President and
chief programmer, John Dailey. This group has been around for a while but
hasn't gotten the exposure they deserve. 

Datagen offers a very complete line of programs for today's WWIV SysOp. Their
line of products are very versatile, very GRAPHICALLY pleasing to look at, and
they are enjoyable for users & SysOps to use.

The support is also GREAT. John is always receptive to comments & suggestions
and will go out of his way to put in features the SysOp's or users want or
think should be added. In this day and age, that is something you hardly ever
see any more (and that's sad indeed.)

Here's a brief overview on some of the programs Datagen Software has to offer:

1)   Melody Maker v3.0 - This is by far the BEST ANSI Music creating and
playing utility ever made. This newest version adds Soundblaster and mouse
support. You can easily create ANSI Music to be posted on your BBS or on any
one of the ANSI Music message subs in the nets (in particular : KLCC Radio
211.2 FM [ANSI Music], TerraNET subtype 10002 hosted by 8851)
This program can be used by users and SysOps alike... anyone who loves music
will enjoy this great program. Its completely graphical and its a joy to use.

2)   Vote-O-Rama v1.0 - Are you tired of that boring built-in voting booth that
WWIV comes with? If so, this is the program for you and your users. This
program is totally Sysop configurable. Your users can even add their OWN
questions for other users to vote on! Unlike WWIV's voting booth, users can ADD
additional responses to voting questions (a great feature since SysOps never
seem to be able to come up with a good set of possible answers.) The graphics
are incredible (as is the case with all of Datagen's products). If you and your
users HATE voting, this program will change you attitudes in a hurry!

3)   Starship Galactica v1.0 - One of Datagen's online door games. This game is
very similar to the classic games of "Battleship" or "Salvo" where you try to
destroy your opponents ships before they destroy yours. In this version, the
battle takes place in space. The twist is that sometimes you can find out where
your opponent (the computer) is hiding by disrupting their cloaking shields.
This game is very addictive and you can expect some fierce competition between
you and your users as you try to destroy the enemy in the least amount. of
moves or try to keep the majority of your ships from being destroyed.

4)   Dig Droid v2.0 - Another online door game. In this one, you navigate your
robot down into a planets core trying to collect as many treasures as you can
before your energy runs low, forcing you to return to the ship to replenish
your power packs. A very tough game to master, but lots of fun.

5)   The Graffiti Wall v5.2 - Sure there are a bunch of Graffiti Walls out
there but THIS one is the best. It's totally Sysop configurable. Allow or
disallow certain users. Restrict dirty words (if you want to). As always the
graphics are great. Let your users have fun adding comments or sayings to the
wall when they log on. 

6)   Data Voice Switch v1.6 - Are you a Sysop who "tries" to run your BBS on
your voice line? Isn't it a HASSLE? Don't you wish you could afford one of
those switch boxes that would automatically take care of it all?  Now you
don't have to... this program is all you need to end your Voice Line/Data Line
blues!

7)   Message To Next Caller v2.1 - Let your users leave a message for whoever
logs onthe BBS after them.

And this is only a SMALL SAMPLE of the many programs Datagen has to offer
(almost 30 in all!).

If you would like more info. on Datagen Software Designs, feel free to send
E-mail to user 28 @ 8851 (TerraNET), or 28 @ 8863 (WWIVnet) and you will be
able to talk to the President, John Dailey himself!

There is also a >WWIVnet< sub for Datagen Support. It's Subtype 24701 hosted by

A few months ago, in late April I believe, I downloaded a file from a local 
BBS called "Random Access Humor" (Editor: Dave Bealer) which is a monthly 
publication for computer related humor. One article in particular caught my
attention, one concerning something called "The Usenet Oracle". The article 
featured a few examples of the messages from the Oracle, and detailed how to 
access it through Internet. Intrigued, I quickly logged on to the network at 
school, and wrote to it. Literally within seconds I received the instruction 
file, and was immediately captivated by what I found.

The Usenet Oracle is a program running at the University of Indiana, written 
and hosted by Steve Kinzler. The way it works is this: Someone e-mails the 
Oracle a question, and then in payment must answer a question, which is 
e-mailed back to the user. Within a day or so, an answer is received in 
e-mail, which is (hopefully) witty and humorous. Basically, everyone answers 
each others questions. But since everyone takes the dual role of the 
grovelling whimpering supplicant, and the omnipotent and omniscient Oracle,
everyone has an equal opportunity to show their creativity.

I was surprised by the creativity and writing ability many of the Oracle
users had. Many of them had a similar style of humor to my own, yet many
were also different. The diversity of styles, and the ease of use meshed
quite well to form this interactive and cooperative system for creative
humor.

One of my personal favorites from the collection of the "best of the best"
was this one where the supplicant asked a question about the existence of
magic. The Oracle, who was at a loss for a good answer, decided to run
a simulation to find out. He loaded up simulations of Merlin (for magic)
and Steven Hawking (for physics) and set them against one another in
a game-show format. Eventually Hawking wins because Merlin violates the
laws of the universe (temporal causality to be precise).

Additionally, there are two Usenet newsgroups (the equivalent of message
subs) in existence for the Oracle. One is used to post the best of the
Oracle responses (termed "Oracularities") as chosen by the "Oracle
Priesthood." The other is a discussion area for the readers. Also, an
anonymous FTP site is available from which you can obtain the back-issues
of the Oracularities, or copies of source code for other non-net oracles.
(FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. It is one of the most popular
systems for transferring files through the Internet. Anonymous FTP sites
allow the general public access to certain directories on those computers).

For a long time I had considered writing some software for WWIVnet, but
had no idea what to make. But after working with the Usenet Oracle for a
while, my path became quite clear. Within a few days, I had the basic
skeleton completed for the "WWIVnet Oracle," although debugging took
considerably longer. By the end of May I had most of the bugs sorted out,
and only one or two more features to add. I managed to test it on a
different computer than my actual BBS, but a few final tests through WWIVnet
itself proved it was working.

Very quickly I managed to get a small group interested in it, but I had
little at my disposal to get the word through the net. So I created a sub
called "The WWIVnet Oracle Discussion" upon which everyone can discuss
the Oracle, and read the best of the oracle responses (termed "Scrolls")
as chosen by the "Seers of the Oracle." I advertised on the "WWIVnet Subs
Yellow Pages" sub, and activity from remote systems started to pick up.
Some of the messages have been quite good, below are a few examples from
the first few months of the Oracle's lifetime.

One of the things I found the most enthralling about the Usenet Oracle
was the mythos that had evolved over time. The Oracle had a pretty well
established persona, as well as it's own history, all of which sprung
up virtually on it's own during the course of it's existence. While the
authors of the individual messages had free liscense to write whatever
they chose, writings that followed the mythos were accepted by the priests
and readers more enthusiastically.

Basically the Oracle is portrayed as an omnipotent being who only answers
questions as his day-job. He's arrogant, and very quick to "ZOT" anyone who
doesn't sufficiently grovel in their questions, or those who ask the dreaded
"woodchuck" question. Also, he lives on Mount Olympus, and has a girlfriend
named Lisa (although over-use of this is frowned upon to the extreme). In
his home he has access to every computer and commuications device known to
man (and in some cases, unkown to man as well), and can contact anyone
anywhere anytime.

Sometimes the Oracle is portrayed as an aging wise man, and other times
an immortal, yet naive, being who is irritated that his job has no fringe
benefits. At other times he's portrayed as an intelligent program running
in his own little directory at the University of Indiana, and is often
having difficulties with his author, Steve Kinzler, clipping his access
when he goes off on a tangent, and not sufficiently answering the questions.

It goes without question that I was happy to see a little bit of a mythos
starting to form on my Orcale as well. Much of the way the WWIVnet Oracle
thinks was borrowed from the Usenet Oracle, but some of it's own history is
starting to be created.

The WWIVnet Oracle is an entity who usually knows all the answers, but
isn't afraid to make one up when he is at a loss. Like the Usenet Oracle,
he is arrogant, taking great joy in the fact that he's not "one of you
lowly humans." He is fascinated by obscure information, and therefore gets
bored with the mundane "life" questions, but enjoys exposing government
conspiracies involving your socks that dissappear in the wash. While he
would be answering questions anyway, he is extremely frustrated at the
dragon that guards him and won't let him leave his room on Mt. Olympus,
a dragon that is old and weak, barely able to blow fire at all.

The most recent development in the WWIVnet Oracle is that it can now
be accessed across net gates. What this means is that it is accessible
from any network that is conencted to WWIVnet. For instance, if you wanted
to contact it from MageNet (my own small local net), you would use a
different e-mail address than "ORACLE@4079", specifically it would be
"WWIVnET ORACLE AT 4079 @705". To access it on other nets, you would simply
replace the "705" with whatever the node number is of the board in your net
that is connected to WWIVnet. As of this writing I am currently seeking
boards willing to carry the Oracle traffic into other nets, as well as the
Oracle Discussion Sub which is detailed towards the end of the article.

Below are several examples from the WWIVnet Oracle Scrolls, as promised.

  Oh simple supplicant, if only everything in your mortal life could work the
way you wish. As you will find, all mortals have the same difficulty as you. By
instinct, all primates enjoy putting things together and then taking them
apart, or vice versa. But there are always complications. Sometimes it is
beyond your control, and sometimes all it takes is to simply look at it from a
different perspective. 

My advice to you in this particular scenario is to throw away that square
block and try using a ROUND peg on that circular hole.

You owe the Oracle a pre-assembled exercise bicycle.

RE: The Oracle requires an answer (EORA000069)


Very interesting question, oh humble supplicant. The answer is this. The
software companies are working with the CIA and Secret Service. It's a
conspiracy to use subliminal messages in software to control the minds of the
masses.

If you haven't noticed, busts are always handled poorly. This is done on
purpose, as piracy helps them spread the subliminal messages. The busts only
serve to attempt to show the public that they prefer you to buy the software
instead of pirating it. That way you still get brainwashed, and they make a
buck at the same time. In fact, [vote for hitler] those messages can be found
[buy more software] almost everywhere [don't use condoms] you look. It's quite
disturbing [love thy government] how they manage to get the [go republican]
darned things into everything. [work eat sleep, work eat sleep]

RE: The Oracle requires an answer (EORA000079)


Well, this interesting question deserves an interesting, and true, answer.
Clinton actually has not inhaled for about 5 years. Several years ago, he
and a few friends were joking around, and one of them said, "You know? I bet a
stiff could make it into office!" And that's when they got the idea. If one of
them were to die, they would try to get him into office. Clinton was the first
to go, so they rigged him up with computer controlled electrodes to control his
muscles. So the entire time you mortals have been fooled! The president is
actually a remote controlled corpse!

You owe the Oracle a thread of the finest cloth, and a presidential campaign.

RE: The Oracle requires an answer (EORA000098)


This question is actually quite interesting, as the answer lies in the Holy
Bible. Computers have always ran at different speeds, as the following 
passages show.

Let's start with SYSTEMS verse 80:86.

Then the lord did say unto the people, "Go now, and create large electronic
machines to perform high speed calculation and data manipulation." And the
followers of the Lord did just that. And verily there were computers, and the
Lord saw that it was good.

Many days and nights passed, and turmoil did return to the land. Opposing
groups were many, and fights unavoidable. Programmers did slay administrators,
data enterers did slay system operators, and many deleted and erased data most
valuable. The Lord looked upon this and was unhappy.

Then the Lord did say unto them all, "Why art thou doing this?" The response
was "because everyone is the same, and all have the same security levels on
our sacred LANs. The administrators need more power, and the loathsome
loser-users need less access."

The lord listened, and saw that changes in security level could not help with
personal computers. So verily did he think. Think he did, and the Lord did say,
"Go forth, and create computers with different speeds. The Administrators and
programmers will have computers bearing the names of speed, and the loathsome
loser-users will use computers bearing the names of slowness, including the
the PC and the XT." The Lord smiled, as he knew the people would listen. 
Listen they did. Computers of all shapes, sizes, speeds, and storage capacities
emerged, and peace was restored to the world. Hallowed be the sacred
differences in computer speeds!


Does that answer your question? Good.

You owe the Oracle a Commie-64 for his collection of obsolete junk.

Using the Oracle:

Using the Oracle is quite simple. While most of the details are described
completely in the Oracle Help-File, I'll cover it briefly here.

To request the Oracle-Help file:  E-mail ORACLE@4079 with "HELP" in the title

To ask a question:   E-mail ORACLE@4079 w/ "TELL ME" in the title.

To answer one that you have received, simply press "A" for Auto-Reply,
and answer the question in the wittiest and most humorous way you can.
Please don't use a quoting system to quote the question, as the Oracle
pastes the question in when it receives your response.

For back-issues of the Scrolls, write to ORACLE@4079 with the word "SCROLL"
in the title, and list (one per line!!) the scroll numbers you want.
For example:

Title:  Gimme da scroll please.
1
2
3

This would tell the Oracle to send you Scrolls #1 through #3.

Capitalization in the titles does not matter, and the Oracle can be reached
from any WWIV board in WWIVnet (and maybe a few non-WWIV boards). Please
don't attempt to access it through net-gating. The Oracle will receive your
messages, but will be unable to send anything back to you.

Gating is supported. For more detail on gating, ask a Sysop with experience
in such matters.

Oracle Discussion: Auto-requestable, Host: 4079, Type: ORACLE

The Scrolls can also be downloaded from my BBS, The Sorcerer's Quarters
at (410)-290-3752. We support ASV/GSA, and QWK messaging, plus a normal
petty guest account. (300 through 14400 baud, 24 hours/day).

To access the Usenet Oracle is similar. Write to oracle@cs.indiana.edu
with the word "help" in the title for the help-file, and "tell me" to
ask a question.

The newsgroups are rec.humor.oracle and rec.humor.oracle.d

The FTP site is cs.indiana.edu in the pub/oracle directory.

  If anyone has any questions concerning the Oracle, be it from a programming
standpoint, or how to use it etc, please feel free to E-mail me (1@4079)
and I'll be glad to answer your questions. If you have serious questions
such as these, they should *not* be sent to the Oracle, for you will not
receive a straight answer. However, if you're asking a simple question
such as "how do I use the Oracle", please read the Oracle help file and
then ask me if you still have questions.

It's the weekend, and you sit down at your computer after a long hard week at
the office (or school). Lately, it seems that the weekends are the ONLY time 
you have to call out to your favorite local BBSes.

You know that after a week of not calling out, many of your favorite message
bases will have MANY new messages to read. You decide to call anyway since 
this is YOUR TIME to relax, and keeping in touch with what's going on in the
BBS world is part of the fun.

After logging on the BBS and reading your 10 pieces of mail, you hit "N" to
read all the new messages. Just as had suspected... the General Discussions
sub has 50 new messages.!! You don't have time to read all 50 of those 
messages, and the Sysop hasn't installed his QWK Offline Mail/Message Reading
program yet. What are you to do ??

You can either 1: (B)ypass this sub altogether; 2: Read the last 5 or 10 
messages; or 3: Scan the titles of the messages for some interesting topics.

Well, like most WWIV users in your predicament, you hit "T" to scan the titles
of the next 10 messages hoping to find some posts that MIGHT be of interest to
you. Here's what you see :

(1)  Well...
(2)  I agree...
(3)  "History Will Teach Us Nothing"              [Random Title]
(4)  DOS 6.0 sucks! 
(5)  ...
(6)  ...
(7)  "Live long and prosper"                      [Random Title]
(8)  Koon & Powell gets sentenced for 18 months.
(9)  HELP ME!
(10) Why...

Oh boy, what a choice, eh?

Seeing nothing of interest in those 10, you hit "T" again, to scan the next 10
messages. You find one title of interest to you, but upon reading the actual 
message, you find it has NOTHING to do with the message title.

You contine on using "T" to scan for titles, totally disregarding the [Random
Title] messages as well as the "..." and other meaningless titles, thinking to
yourself: "Why should I read a message from a person who was too lazy to write
a real title ?? "

After doing this for a few subs, you get frustrated. You've scanned over 300
message titles and have only seen 50 "real titles". Of those 50, only 10 were
of any interest to you. 

Seeing as your time online is almost over, you decide to log off, not calling
again until another week passes...
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Did that scenario sound familiar to you? If so you are not alone. Today, many
BBS users are entering Random or unspecific tiles for their messages.

Lately, in WWIVnet, there has been many heated discussions on the #1 National
SysOp sub as well as other subs arguing over the validity or worthlessness of
Random and Unspecific Message Titles.

Here is a post from a Sysop who believes Random Titles ARE OK :

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Title  : Oh jeez...
Author : Psychomaster #1 @7107 

    I don't see why some of you people make that big of a deal about 
random titles... I really don't mind them.  In fact, a lot of the 
time, I don't even really read post titles... who cares about the 
titles, it's what's in the post that I read the message bases for. 

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

And here is MY REPLY to that message (somewhat edited and re-worded to be 
included in this article.) :

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Title  : Random Titles and "..."
RE     : Oh jeez...
Author : King Lerxt #1 @8863

Yes, and in order to get some users to even read the messages there 
has to be an interesting title in there. Tell me this, which message 
would you rather read, if they had the following titles ? :

(1)  hdkjsahdkahg
(2)  This is an IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM THE HOST. PLEASE READ
(3)  The theory of relativity
(4)  "My god, it's full of stars"   [Random Title]

The above were just a few examples of titles. Message #2 looks like 
it is VERY important and if it had a random or silly title, it might 
be skipped or bypassed, and the people who needed to read that 
message would probably miss it. In message number 3, some user MIGHT 
be VERY interested in that topic, so they WILL read it, but they 
don't have the time to be reading every message, so they are ALWAYS 
using the "T" command to scan for interesting titles. They call 
their favorite BBS (Blue Thunder, for example) and can only get on 
once a week (a TRUE fact over at Blue Thunder, hehe) and the BBS 
DOESN'T have an offline mail reader (Blue Thunder does though), and 
there are 50 new messages in each sub they have in their Q-scans, so 
what else can they do BUT to use the "T" command to scan for 
interesting topics to read ?

You are making too many generalizations about BBS users. These days, 
users will do ANYTHING to get through a BBS as fast as possible, 
especially when its costing them some $$$. Anyone who uses a bogus 
title for a message (ie: "flhkwskks", or "....." is ruining the 
whole idea of BBSing, which is:

*****
To effectively communicate with others and get information out to as 
many people as possible.
*****

Here is an example that demonstrates my point:

Say your dog is lost and you want to get him back. Would you post 
flyers all over town that read in big letters:  "GOD WILL RETURN 
SOON", and then underneath that, in smaller type, you go ahead and 
describe your lost dog ??

Well of course you wouldn't. But, when people use bogus or random 
titles in their messages, that's EXACTLY what they are doing. 

Just as most people wouldn't take the time to stop and read a flyer 
annoucing the 2nd comming of Jesus, not many users are going to want 
to pay ANY attention to a message that has a title of "..." or 
[Random Title] in it.

Even though the flyer about your lost dog IS important to you, you 
are SEVERELY limiting your chances of someone finding your dog when 
you titled your flyer with a title that DID NOT pertain to the 
subject at hand. 

ÄÄÄÄ End of my reply ÄÄÄÄ

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Some users will say that posting random or bogus message titles is lazy. Some
will say that NOT reading EVERY message posted on a sub is lazy. Some users 
just don't care.

Who is right? 

What are we to do?

It all goes back to the orginal purpose of a BBS (Bulletin Board System): 


Its NOT about leeching files.

Its NOT about playing games.

It's about COMMUNICATING with others.


Just as it's real life counterpart (the bulletin board at your local school or
office which communicates the wants and needs of people) the electronic BBS 
can be an invaluable tool. You can use it to ask others all over the country 
a question on how to fix a computer problem you might be having. You know 
SOMEONE will be able to help you out, since a netted BBS reaches so many 
people in a short amount of time.

Why would anyone want to "hide" the intent of their posts? Why would anyone
want to make it difficult for other users to FIND the information they are 
looking for? Why would YOU want to make it harder to get the help you so 
desperately need?

It's all up to you, the BBS user.

Make the right choice...and take an extra second to post a meaningful message
title. You'll be glad you did.


ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

The Mod-of-The-Month Selection represents my choice of what appears to
be a useful, practical mod to WWIV.  It does not mean it is the best
mod posted or even that it works as I may not have tested it.  Given
the limitations of this media, uuencoded mods are NOT eligible for
selection as mod-of-the-month.

Since WWIVnews took an unexpected hiatus, there's been sort of a backlog of
articles, so we'll be taking care of that with this column by reprinting
those mods which have been selected since the last issue of WWIVnews. The 
first mod allows you to install a safe, but tailorable guest account for
WWIV 4.23.

The Guest mod allows you to make a guest account on the BBS that can be used
by multiple users without an account. The mod assumes you will make the
guest account and set it's security levels, restrictions, ARs, and DARs to
your liking. NOTE: to make the account a guest account, it is only important
that you set the G (guest) restriction on the account. You should probably
also edit the logon prompt if your guest account is not named "GUEST". The
mod is hard coded to allow 10 minutes per call on all guest logons. Because
the guest account is shared by multiple users, certain restrictions are hard
coded. A guest account cannot edit it's defaults. A guest account cannot kill
(and thus read) E-Mail it has sent. A guest account cannot upload (in case the
guest is hostile, and only wishes to tie up the BBS for more than 10 minutes).
It is up to the Sysop to set all other restrictions desired on a guest account.

My apologies to anyone who has done a similar mod, I know there are several.
I wasn't able to find any when I need the mod, so wrote this myself. I hope
people find the code useful.

I am not responsible for any problem cause by your use of my code of course.
I encourage you to back up everything before installing this, or any mod.

This next mod selection is by Gate Keeper 1@8143 and corrects what some 
consider an annoying "feature" of WWIV.

Ok, Well, I wrote up this mod because I have been having mail problems. So
I had to delete my E-Mail data file..it got corrupted or something I guess. 
It happends once in a while. Anyway, Usually when I do that users get on and
it says "You have 5 pieces of mail waiting, read it now?" then they hit yes 
and it says "You have no mail" now. 

Is that good? 

No, That is a bug in some ways, I mean, it should never actually do that 
according to logic but about 5 WWIV BBS's down here have done this, this 
mod is small and should be considered to standard code to get rid of this 
annoying thing... This mod doesn't do much, it could be changed to have the
checkmail function return a number when asked to or do a few other things. 
But this will do it. All it does is get the real number of mail waiting before
it says you have any by opening up the E-Mail file and checking. This reads the
HD for a second, but it works, and its better then having that problem 
mentioned above, I didn't stick the extra char's with the old because I just
want it to be one easy block code so hear it is...

Extended Description:
---------------------
        When inserting subs, dirs, or chains, this will allow you to
enter '$' at the insert prompt to insert the sub, dir, or chain at the
end of the list, just like in ConfEdit.  A relativly simple
modification, but quite a handy one (for those of you who have large #'s
of subs, and can never remember the last number when added new ones!).

Format:
 ++  Add this line
 --  Delete this line
 +-  Change this line
 ==  This line same

  If you just delete the characters (++ and what not), it should line up,
  unless the line was line wrapped.  Any line not begining w/ one of the
  symbols above was line wrapped, and should be joined w/ the line above.

Dear Editor:

Recently, the 512 AC suffered a rather interesting connection problem I'd like
to share with the readers of WWIVnews. While this was a localized problem,
the nature of the problem was such that it could easily happen again if one
isn't too careful.

First, a little background: 

Want to establish a direct connection with someone instead of going through a
server? Be aware there are some things to consider before going ahead with a 
direct connect. How will this connection affect the other connections in the 
network, and will you end up being the carrier for the LD traffic for more than
just yourself.  

A good analysis of your connections could prevent you from finding out after
the bills come in that connecting directly to your good buddy's BBS in 
Saskatchewan has also made you the conduit for half that area's packet 
traffic!  

Remembering the way WWIVnet logic is applied to node numbers may prevent 
headaches and loss of money, and sketching mail routes between nodes on a
piece of paper also helps a great deal. The way it works is like this:

If your direct connection request causes fewer hops to occur between someone 
else and your friend, you route will be the route chosen. 

If the number of hops between systems is the same or more as having a network 
servers handle it, the network server takes priority. 

Got all that? Ok, with this in mind, here's what happened to AC512 that
caused all the headaches:

OK, remember that mail going from point A to point D will take the shortest 
route. Default is to go to a netsever, or a node with the lowest number if 
there are several alternatives.

In our situation here, we had Filo's net server, point A, (@1040) routing 
mail (normally) through point B, @1021, which then goes to point C (@1043) 
our LD netserver, then to point D (@1041) our local server, and then to all
of us here in Austin.

Filo had set one of his connects on 1040 to a BBS located in Spain (yes, 
that's in Europe, of all places!), WWIVnet @871. This node was having some 
trouble connecting with @1040, so Filo added a connect to @1041 to hopefully 
cure @871's connect problems. As a result, @1040-@871-@1041 is now that the
routing being taken for all the mail coming to Austin. 

Can anyone see what happened?

Since @871 hasn't connected to Filo since the change to the connections, a
9+ Meg file started accumulating on Filo's server. Meanwhile, our traffic
was waiting to go overseas before coming back here!

All this dawned on me as I was trying to determine why the mailpacket arriving
on @1021 was not containing ANYTHING for our local systems, as well as some LD
systems that connect to @1043. When I started looking for connects that @1040
and @1043 have in common, I saw the "short-circuit". A quick voice call to 
Filo corrected the matter, and as expected the dam did burst open and Austin
was flooded with about 10 days worth of backlogged network traffic.

While some might see this as just a local problem, it could just as easily
happen anywhere if people aren't careful about setting up their network
connections.

Dear Editor:

DOS 6.2 has arrived, and once again we're given dull white text on black as
the command line default. While it's true that we can always use ANSI.SYS
and the PROMPT command to modify things, this takes up memory that some
of us can find a better use for it. This is especially true when all some
of us want to do is simply change the default screen colors to something
more readable on an aging, fading monitor.

Here is the procedure for changing the default colors. Some of the addresses 
may be different on some releases, but the principle is the same. Remember, 
the new color only take effect when you do a CLS.

     DEBUG \COMMAND.COM
     -RCX
     CX BAE5

     -S 100 L BAE5 CD 10
     22CC:432B
     22CC:4337
     22CC:435F
     22CC:436C
     22CC:4370
     22CC:4376
     -U 4300
     -
     -              Enter U a few times
     -
     -U
     22CC:4366      B406      MOV       AH,06
     22CC:4368      B707      MOV       BH,07
     22CC:436A      32DB      XOR       Bl,BL
     -Q

What you're looking for here is the MOV BH,07 instruction. Remember to hit 
ENTER twice after the RCX instruction. The address you get after RCX and the
listing when you enter the S command determines where you start looking for 
the MOV instruction. 
Note that in the example above, the address for the MOV you're after is 4368.
Add 1 to that address (whatever you come up with) and then do the following:

     DEBUG \COMMAND.COM
     -D 4369  L1
     22CC:4369                     07
     -Q

You should see 07 off to the right, otherwise go back and search again. When 
you've found the correct address, do the following:

     DEBUG \COMMAND.COM
     -E   4369
     22CC:4369                07.
     -W
     Writing 0BAFB bytes
     -Q

After you do the E instruction, debug will return the address with the "07.";
now select the colors you want, and enter them after the period. The first
number denotes the background color, while the second is the foreground
color. Be sure that you don't enter a number larger than 7 for the first 
number, or the screen will flash! 

Here's the list of colors as DOS sees'em:

                   Black   - 0     Grey           - 8
                   Blue    - 1     Bright Blue    - 9
                   Green   - 2     Bright Green   - A
                   Cyan    - 3     Bright Cyan    - B
                   Red     - 4     Bright Red     - C
                   Magenta - 5     Bright Magenta - D
                   Brown   - 6     Yellow         - E
                   White   - 7     Bright White   - F

You may want to change where you start searching from. The important thing is 
to look for the MOV BH,07 instruction.

While it' *is* true that ANSI.SYS can do the same things this patch does,
there are those out there who consider ANSI.SYS a waste of memory even in
this day and age of UMB's. Still, the general aesthetic non-configurability
of the basic DOS environment reminds me of how Peter Norton once paraphrased
Henry Ford: "You can have it in any color you want, so long as it's black!"

Dear Editor:

With the release of WWIV 4.23, many a Sysop has voiced concerns that WWIVnet
in it's current state may be assimilated inside FIDOnet. I think it's an 
unwarranted fear mostly found in people who are wary of change.

Ive been involved with WWIVnet since August of 1990. I've seen the network 
grow, change and adapt. In it's present format it has become quite viable. 
Perhaps it's not as well spread outside North America as FIDOnet, or
INTERNET/USENET, however WWIVnet continues to grow and expand. With the
multi-language addition it will most certainly attract new systems from other
areas world wide. 

What has made WWIV software popular among those who use it is it's user
friendly interface. With a minimum of computer literacy, most have been able
to run a netted WWIV BBS. Such is not the case with FIDOnet compatible BBS
softwares.  

In the past year we have seen features such as multi-network capability. This
has brought to life numerous WWIV based networks, some which are bound to
expand, but most are nothing more then local networks who's well-being is
entirely dependent on one individual, the N.C. Most of these smaller nets come
and go without affecting WWIVnet.  

As AC in WWIVnet and IceNET for the 514 area, I've noticed recently that most
of the BBSes that have had longevity with WWIVnet also carry either WWIVlink,
IceNET as well as local networks.  

We've had FIDOnet in the 514 area code for as long as I can remember. Twice a 
local system had decided to gate subs between FIDO and WWIV. Twice it was 
dropped due to the lack of interest from the majority of the sysops in both 
networks. 

Making WWIV software compatible with FIDOnet will permit those who already 
gate subs or run a dual system to continue to do so. Those who are like myself
who like things quick and dirty and had been thinking FIDO will take the leap,
but for most it will be nothing more then an extra feature they have the 
option to use.

The philosophy behind both networks is totally different from both the 
standpoint of the Sysop and also that of the users. We can all enjoy the
anonimity that WWIV provides us. This is extremely important to those who are
part of visible and not so visible minorities. As a female pagan, I have the
opportunity to discuss with others all over without the fear of being
persecuted for my beliefs in my daily life. 

Fidonet does not have the same standards. For instance it is common practice 
to send files via the network, through automatic request. WWIVnet is a more 
cost conscious network, where Sysops are concerned about the extra cost of 
having routing information imbedded in the messages. 

Even the structure of both networks is different. My understanding is that it 
is easier to weed out bad apples in WWIVnet, and keep some control over the
systems that are in the network. Have you tried moderating a heavy traffic
Fidonet conference?

Assimilated inside Fidonet? In some people's dreams only. Those who have made
the network what it is today will not go Fidonet tommorow. If they had wished
to  do so, they would have left long ago.

Editor's Reply:

As most of you know, I personally have a rather negative stance on Fidonet,
its sysops, and its policies. As Fidonet compatibility with WWIV comes 
closer to becoming part of the basic WWIV package, this issue will become
a bit more heated. A future issue of WWIVnews will spotlight the multi-net
WWIV, and I'll have a more in-depth commentary on the matter then.
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Dear Editor:

Since the arrival of RIP graphics, many WWIV sysops have encouraged both Wayne
Bell and myself to jump on the RIP bandwagon and add RIP graphics to WWIV. 
This issue is one which has both pros and cons and deserves careful 
consideration.

First, it is not now apparent which, if any, of the competing graphics 
packages will emerge as the "winner." Of these, there are three that stand
out as potential standards - NAPLPS, RIP, and RoboFX.

NAPLPS is a graphics package which was available before RIP. It has some 
decent support and many adherents. Apparently it is more compact in its 
graphics design. The last blurb that I saw on it mentioned that a terminal 
program - NAPLPS/JPEG - would have 3D-Windows, CUA/GUI interfacing, mouse 
support, and built-in protocols including Xmodem, Ymodem, and Zmodem. 

RIP is the second of the competing graphics programs to be developed and has
the advantage of having Qmodem and Telix announce that they intend to support
it. It is, however, built to an EGA standard while NAPLPS and RoboFX are
built to a VGA standard. 

RoboFX is the latest entrant to the field. It is promoted by RoboBoard BBS 
and, according to some, has the best graphics of any of these graphic designs.

So, one problem facing WWIV is that of selecting which of these competing 
products would seem to be the best. At one time, Roland De Graff, the VBBS 
author thought that his VGIX would become the standard, but apparently he has
given up the project after spending several months on coding the VGIX project.

A second problem is one of disk space and time on line. As I understand it, 
these graphical interfaces may be like the ANSI graphics on our own boards and
sent over the modem; however, such an approach is time consuming and somewhat 
slow. The graphics, on the other hand, may be downloaded from the board and 
triggered by the BBS. In that instance, the actual graphic would be on the 
user's hard disk and the imaging would be much faster. The problem here (as 
I see it) is that most users will not want to devote multi-megabytes of their
hard disks just to see "pretty pictures". If hard disk space becomes cheaper
and/or CD-ROM usage becomes greater, this disadvantage might change rather 
quickly. However, until users are willing to use their hard disks for such 
storage, the use of such graphics will almost demand that sysops stay with 
"standard" menus.

A third problem is that it appears that the primary way to obtain such graphic
capability is by the purchase of "libraries" from the distributor which are 
then compiled into the BBS. This would (I think) virtually mean that we would 
have to distribute some OBJ files as part of the BBS code or that WWIV sysops
would have to individually purchase that library code. Currently, the RIP 
people sell that for $199. The RIP_PAINT program is also $199 and is needed 
to create individualized graphics unless one registers the shareware version 
which is $69. The shareware version will produce graphics that can be seen 
locally but will not produce graphics for over the modem use until it is 
registered.

So, the questions are:

    1)  Should WWIV Software Services invest in Rip Graphics?
    2)  Are sysops willing to pay the $199 or $69 for drawing
        programs to produce such graphics?
    3)  Are users willing to devote megabytes of their hard
        disks for storage of RIP graphics.
    4)  Is RIP the graphic that will "win" the graphics race?

Clearly answers to such questions must be determined in the months ahead. In 
order for us to make the best choice, it will be advantageous for WWIV Sysops 
to educate themselves regarding these types of graphical interfaces, to call 
board which use them, and to become familiar enough with them that they can
guide us in this choice.

Editor's Reply: 

For those not aware, RoboTerm is out now. Reports from its users say that the
RoboFX support is a bit buggy, and not very tolerant of minor menuing errors.
Still, it has one definate advantage over RIP, and that's the fact that
it supports VGA level graphics. RIP is *still* mired in EGA, which renders
it unadaptable for most GUI environments according to several Windows and
OS/2 programmers who've looked at the routines.

Another problem with RIP is the extortion fees that the designers of the
RIP Menuing programs are demanding for their wares. Without getting into
a debate over the idiocy of believing that demand can automatically 
dictate a higher expense for software, the bottom line is that very few,
if any, WWIV sysops are willing to pay for any additional software save
for the cost of registering WWIV itself. 

There's a comment a local TBBS sysop once made when comparing WWIV to TBBS.
He claimed that he couldn't understand why everyone in WWIV and WWIVnet
hadn't registered each and every WWIV-based chain, game and/or util for as
low as they cost. In the TBBS world, he claimed, the average cost per 
onliner is $100, and the average cost per TBBS-specific utility is $150!
Compared to these costs, the average WWIV setup is a drop in the bucket!

Of course, the average WWIV system has more to offer than the average
still-rooted-in-monochrome-RBBS TBBS setup, but that's beside the point.
The question still remains whether WWIV Sysops are willing to fork over
the bucks to purchase something that's obviously overpriced just to 
make their systems just a bit more flashier.

I'm open to comments on this one, folks. Filo's opened up a serious can
of worms, and we need to see if they're worth fishing with!

Dear Editor:

I've noticed that many people are interested in changing the flashing red
on their boards to non-flashing for ALL new users. But usually they don't
know what the number codes are for the standard IBM color set, or have
a hard time figuturing it out. Here is a simple system to use to figure
out the color numbers:

0 Black
1 Blue
2 Green
3 Cyan
4 Red
5 Magenta
6 Brown
7 Grey

Add 8 to make it Intense (bright)  (brown becomes yellow)

Add the color number * 16 for background (ignore to leave black).

Add 128 to make it flashy..

So you want Red(4) + Intense(8) + Black-Background(0*16=0) And no flashy.
               4 + 8 + 0 = 12.

Or look at this way, 140 - 128(flashy) = 12.

So non-flashy intense red is 12.

Or you could look at it this way.. A byte consists of 8 bits.

Num:  7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
bit:  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
      | | | | | | | |
      | | | | | +-+-+-Color            (0-7)
      | | | | +-------Intensity        (8)
      | +-+-+---------Background color (0-7)*(16)
      +---------------Flashy           (128)

Bits 0 through 2 are the color. Bit 3 when set is intensity, bits 4 through
6 are the background color, and bit 7 is for the flashy..

Therefore a bit sequence like this:  10001100   Would give you 128+8+4=140,
the flashing red. Remove bit 7 and you're left with 00001100 which is
only 8+4=12.

Ah yessss, the good old stock WWIV colors. To this day, I've never fully
understood why Wayne Bell chose those colors in the first place - especially
the dull white on black! Of course, while flashing red is useful when
used sparingly, the fact remains that most people find it annoying as hell
when used too much. Combined with the fact that a *lot* of registered 
Sysops have chosen to actually change the stock WWIV color defaults to 
something more aesthetically pleasing - and a lot of them use color #6
now redefined as non-flashing red - and combined with the fact that we have
this thing called WWIVnet and its subs...well, you get the picture.

In any case, thanks for the briefer, Kink Lerxt!

This article contains an internal memo from Sprint regarding the demise of
what was once the best friend of file leech and Sysop alike, PC Pursuit. The
memo was originally reposted on the Usenet newsgroup comp.dcom.telecom by
the group's moderator, Patrick Townson. All editorial content and commentaries
after the actual memo are Patrick's, and not mine.

An internal memorandum was circulated recently to employees of Sprint
announcing the discontinuance of the PC Pursuit program as of April 1.
A copy of the internal memorandum was forwarded to the Digest along with
a letter being mailed as of this date to customers of PCP and 'host
customers' which receive connections from PCP users. The memo is first,
followed by the letter to customers.

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

The following letters are being sent to our customers starting today.
I want to briefly explain the phase-out plan and important differences
between PC Pursuit services and Host outdial services.

PC Pursuit and PC Business Call will be phased out at 12:01 AM, April
1, 1994. At that time we will cancel all remaining TAMS ID's which are
identified to be PC Pursuit or PC Business Call. After this time, cus-
tomers with these ID's will no longer be able to place calls to the
outdial rotaries. However OUTDIAL CAPABILITIES WILL STILL REMAIN ON
THE NETWORK FOR HOST-INITIATED OUTDIAL CALLS AND CALLS INITIATED WITH
NON-PC PURSUIT TAMS ID'S.

It is product management's intent to phase out all forms of outdial on
the network within the next 12-18 months. During the next coming months,
we will identify all outdial activities from all hosts and standard 
TAMS IDs, domestic and international, in order to quantify the impact
of such a pbase out. However, at this time, we are cancelling PC Pursuit
and PC BusinessCall accounts only. We suggest no further responses be
given to outdial opportunities in RFP's or opportunity requests.

We will meet with you to discuss the phase out plan and ask for any
comments or suggestions. There may be significant dissatisfaction
displayed by some of our more vocal PC Pursuit customers. We have set
up an 800 number so that these people can vent their frustration (see
letter below). We would appreciate it if no product manager names were
given to any customer, as these calls are extremely long, and for the
most part, non-productive. Inquiries coming from the press should be
directed to Media Relations, which will make arrangments to answer
questions and conduct interviews. Norm Black at 404-359-6096 is the
contact for all media inquiries or Evette Fulton at 202-328-7411.
Stephen Rys (x-5743) or Paul Golder (x-5797) will handle internal

1994.   PAT]

Dear Customer:

Over the past several months, Sprint has conducted a thorough business
evaluation of the PC Pursuit and PC BusinessCall services. Based on the
results of this evaluation, Sprint's PC Pursuit and PC BusinessCall
services will be discontinued April 1, 1994. We regret any inconvenience
this may cause you. 

We are talking this step in order to focus our resources on the growing
demand for local dial-in access to online, "informatin provider" computer
hosts which are directly connected to SprintNet. The continued growth
in the number and variety of these dedicated hosts and host applications
has minimized the need for PC Pursuit and PC BusinessCall. Today,
access to these host based applications far surpasses teh usage of
dial-out access via PC Pursuit and PC BusinessCall. 

Your PC Pursuit or PC BusinessCall ID/password will become inoperable 
on April 1, 1994 per this notification. No further charges for these
services will be billed to your credit card or electronic funds transfer
account after this April 1, 1994 date. If you would like to discontinue
your service prior to April 1, 1994 please call 1-800-877-2006 between
the hours of 8:30 AM and 5:30 PM, Monday through Friday, Eastern Standard
Time.  If you have already discontinued your PC Pursuit or PC BusinessCall
service, please disregard this notification.

January 24, 1994

Dear (personalized):

Over the past several months, Sprint has conducted a thorough business
evaluation of the PC Pursuit and PC BusinessCall services. Based on
the results of this evaluation, Sprint's PC Pursuit and PC BusinessCall
services will be discontinued, effective April 1, 1994. We regret any
inconveneince that this may cause you or your users. 

All PC Pursuit and PC BusinessCall customers are receiving the enclosed
letter which includes a 60-day notice of the discontinuation of the
services. On April 1, 1994, all PC Pursuit and PC BusinessCall ID/passwords
will become inoperable, which will require that these users select an
alternative method to access your host. 

If you would like to discuss alternative dial-up access to SprintNet,
please contact your sales representative, or call 1-800-877-2006.

TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: So there you have it, officially from
Sprint. PCP is discontinued as of April 1. The rumors have been going
around for quite some time, since even before Sprint discontinued 
accepting new customers for the service a few months ago. 

FYI, a bit of history: the old Telenet system began operation in the
early 1970's. Its E-Mail service called 'Telemail' was the first of
its kind I think. Just about ten years ago, in 1983-84 the PC Pursuit
service began, initially with just seven or eight cities which were on
outdials, and about the same number of places which had local indials.
But initially, the service operated in a different way. PC Pursuit had
its own indials, and for purposes of security, it operated on a callback
scheme. Users dialed into the PC Pursuit links, identified themselves,
then were called back at the phone number of record at Telenet. Once
connected by callback, *then* the user was allowed to make a single 
connection to the one of seven or eight places served including Chicago.
After each call, the connection was dropped and the user had to dial
back in again through the callback modems for another session. All
connections were at either 110 or 300 baud initially, and within a
year or so of starting the service, 1200 baud was available in quite
a few places. Within about a year also, the callback scheme was dropped
and users began calling in on the 'regular' indials for Telenet in
their local area.

I was a customer of PC Pursuit from its second week of operation
through about two years ago, although in the last year or so of my
membership I used it rarely. The Net Exchange BBS was started about
a year after PC Pursuit itself started, and was intended as a place
for users to ask questions and make comments. In the beginning, to
reach the Net Exchange BBS, one had to use the Washington, DC outdials
and dial a seven digit number, or dial direct to the same seven digit
number (plus area code) if one could not 'get through' on PC Pursuit
due to congestion. Since 1990, the Net Exchange BBS has been a distri-
bution point for TELECOM Digest, with each issue of the Digest made
available to NetXBBS users in the 'files' area.

Initially, the service allowed unlimited nighttime and weekend useage
for $25 per month, on open account billing. The open account billing
was discontinued after a couple years because of considerable abuse
and fraud by customers, and it was grandfathered only to those of us
who had had it all along. All new customers had to pay by credit card
or EFT. Toward the end of my subscription there were only two or three
of us still on the system using open account billing. A few years
ago, due to abuse by users who were racking up many, many (in the
hundreds of) hours each month, the program was changed to allow for
25/50 hours per month at the rate of $25/$50 per month, with additional
hours above the limit at an extra fee. Also a few years ago, the original
Telenet network was sold to Sprint, the company which runs it today.
As Telenet, it was part of GTE. 

In the late 1980's I wrote an essay which was distributed on Usenet
and quite a few independent BBSs called 'Let Your Fingers do the Walking'
which discussed a bug in the Telenet network at that time which permitted 
connection to *any host* -- 'authorized outdial' or not -- with a legitimate
PC Pursuit ID/password. I listed several international points which could
be reached via Telenet including the British Telecom Master Clock and
the Master Clocks of a few other countries including Japan and the Hong
Kong Telephone Company. I discussed connections to the host systems on
several data networks accessible through those network's gateways to
Telenet, and how to use the outdials of those other networks after first
gatewaying to them via Telenet using ones PC Pursuit password. I included
network addresses for several live, 'online' terminals at the help desks
of those other networks where one could 'chat' interactively with 
whoever was on duty. Management at Telenet was quite upset with me for
publishing that article, and the loopholes were closed shortly after
it appeared on the net.

From the beginning of the Telenet network until just a couple years
ago, Telenet was assigned 'area code' 909 for its administrative use
since all hosts on the network otherwise had addresses of the form 
xxxyyy or xxxyyyy where xxx was the area code where they were located
and yyy or yyyy was the 'address'. 909yyy or 909yyyy was used to 
connect with the Telenet administration itself. Numerous addresses
of the form 909xxx connected to all sorts of test ports for network
diagnostic purposes. Some were 'loop arounds', others presented curious
results when one connected to them. 

So, about ten years after it started, PC Pursuit is dead. In the
beginning it was a radical, very modern innovation. A decade later,
it is just another way of connecting, and not a very good one at that.
So from a nostalgic point of view, I am sorry to see it go, but from a
business and effeciency standpoint, its demise is overdue.

ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

While stock WWIV does have some decent online help, even as a Sysop I've had
the need for some sort of "quick reference card" to help remember commands
from time to time. As a service to WWIVnetters everywhere, I've prepared such
a beast from the WWIV documentation itself. Feel free to print this out and 
post them somewhere near your BBS for future reference.

Over the years we've seen dozens of text files on how to be a good sysop.
Heck, there's even a couple of *books* on the subject! But have any of you
ever seen anything on how to be a good *Co-Sysop*? Hopefully, this article
will fill that gap.

QUALIFICATIONS, ANYONE?
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Before I go any further, your probably wondering what the heck *my* own
qualifications for writing are article like this are. Well, right now I am a
Co-Sysop on both of Jim's (IceNET 1@1) boards, and I've been a Co-Sysop on TGWN
(IceNET @1) for a while now. Recently Jim asked for help on his second board,
Paragon (WWIVnet @7654), as well. I was more than happy to lend him a hand 
there too. I am also aCo-Sysop on several boards in the WNY Area, although I 
mainly confine my roamings to The Keep of Ultimate Evil (IceNET @7), Artificial
-NON-Intelligence (IceNET @7667) and the The Sanitarium (IceNET @5).


UNDERSTANDING THE DEVIOUS MIND OF THE SYSOP
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Before you can go further here it will help to understand what a Sysop is 
first. A Sysop is the person that owns the board, pays the bills, and has
the number one account.

The first two stipulations there are obvious, but the last some may question. 
Why is the Sysop the guy with the number 1 account? Because that is usually 
the account that gets the feedbacks, complaints, and complements under normal
circumstances. The person who owns that account is the one that people think 
of as the sysop, whether those people are users or other Sysops. It is from
that account that the Sysop normally deals with other sysops in the network,
and in most cases it's required that the Sysop conduct any official network
business from that particular account!

Yes, there may be some exceptions to this general rule, but exceptions are not
the general rule. That is why they are called exceptions.


SYSOPS AND CO-SYSOPS
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

There are three difference classes of BBSers. Sysops, Co-Sysops and Users. 
Every now and then you hear of the weird half beast called the "Remote Sysop",
but I don't believe in their existence. There are only sysops (the person
owning the #1 account) and Co-Sysops. A Co-Sysop with a 255 is just a very 
trusted Co-Sysop. With this in mind, I don't see any reason for the fourth 
class of "Remotes".
 
Besides, to do any real major work on a board it is a great help to be
local to the BBS computer. Yes, you can do a lot from remote, but I can't
stand doing anything more than adding a sub or two that way. To do major
work, being local is almost a requirement. Case in point, recently Jim
wanted some major remodeling of Paragons message base section done. I could
have done the remodeling from remote but it would have taken a long time to
do. I was reluctant to do it because of the time it would have taken. So,
Jim then invited me over to his place so that I could do the work there.
What would have been a good 15 hour job from remote only took about 6 hours
from the local keyboard.
One thing that does bug me a bit are those Co-Sysops that sign posts "Co-Sysop 
of This-That Board". The way I figure it, this is just a power trip gimmick.
After all, if a user calls a board regularly they should know who the 
Co-Sysops there are, and don't need to be reminded all the time.

The reason I figure that it's just part of power tripping is like this: 
signing all posts as "Co-Sysop" normally is done just to intimidate those 
persons the Co-Sysop is talking to. If people are talking about abortion, or 
some other debate topic, and some Co-Sysop signs a post "Co-Sysop of this 
board", then you have intimidation. It might not be intended, but it will
have this effect. Whether intentional or otherwise does not matter; it is 
the effect that matters.

There are only two cases I can think of where I would sign a post as
"Co-Sysop": 

1) When dealing with a new user.

2) when dealing with other Sysops in the network. 

Both of these, I should add, usually only occur in e-mail situations. 

Now, I don't expect the sysops in the network to take my "Co-Sysop" as
meaning anything either when I deal with them. Just sometimes, if they know
me a little, instead of going through Jim I can cut out the middle man and
get something done quicker by sending the mail myself I'll do it. Normally
who I am dealing with there knows a little about me already, such as
Midnight Tree Bandit (the Weirdo of WWIVlink fame).

There are several things that Co-Sysops can do for the Sysop of a board. I am 
going to list some of the things I have done in the past. These are not
the only things that a Co-Sysop can do, but they are the obvious ones that
are seen around in common existence. They are :

1) Sub-board Management.
2) Transfer Section Management.
3) On-Line Chains Management.
4) User Record Management.
5) The Resident Modder.
6) A little of everything.


SUB-BOARD MANAGEMENT
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

This is the guy who keeps the subs of a board moving. He posts a lot.
Deletes "below-par" posts. Network Validates the net subs the board hosts.
Keeps track of who posts and who doesn't. Help people out in regards to the
sub-boards.

Posting a lot is very important for a Co-Sysop of this type to do. Leading by 
example is much easier than just telling people what to do. If some Co-Sysop 
just posts "Why aren't you all posting here?" or "Post or Die" messages, then
people are going to think the Co-Sysop is just plain weird.
I will admit, I've done both of those, but I try for messages like that
to be more humorous than anything else. I post a lot on the subs. If I post
something on the political sub I know that I can get others to respond
because they will disagree with me. Then, as long as I am staying on topic
others will also stay on topic because they are mainly responding to me.

The one problem I have found with this formula is "BBSing Burnout". I can get 
so involved in debates at times that I don't want to call a board I'm a co- on
because I don't really want to post a message on some debate topic at times. 
(I know, some of you reading this are thinking that Post-Aholic Louie doesn't
want to post sometimes. Wow! But then, I even amaze myself at times).

When I then call, finally, I have so much work to do on the board that I don't
want to deal with much really. Just to much to do that then I don't want to do
it because there is so much to be done.

Deleting "Below Par" posts is very important as well. If users are posting bad
messages it can be worse than having users than don't post at all. Keeping the
message bases stocked with high quality posts is something that is very 
important for a boards.

But what should be deleted? That can be a difficult question to answer at 
times. The obvious things that have to be deleted are those messages that
are just vulgarity. Sometimes new users just log on a board and post a
message of everything vulgar they ever heard. Things like that should always
be deleted.

What *is* vulgar? I normally just regulate vulgarity to things without a
point. A list of swear words about the Sysop. Now, there are adult subs on
some boards, and what might be vulgar to one person might not be to another.
Keeping those adult posts to the adult subs is something that should be
enforced though.

Also, keeping posts on topic is important as well. What might be "Below par" 
on the political sub might be perfect for the General sub. That's where
the Co-Sysop just hits "M" and moves the post to the proper sub. Normally I
follow that up with an e-mail to the user that made the simple mistake and
explain what I did and why.

Now, network validation is something that also means dealing with "below
par" posts. Network validation means reading, and possibly posting on, the
subs hosted by the board your a Co-Sysop on. On TGWN and Paragon net-validation
is turned on in //BOARDEDIT for all the subs Jim hosts.

I read the subs determine for each post weather it meets our standards for the
sub in question. I also have some special rules for network subs that I 
enforce. The rules I use are something I recommend for all systems in the 
network for boards that host a sub. They are :

1. Delete anything with profanity in it. There are people out there that
   don't mind swear words, and there are people who do mind. If your hosting
   a sub you want to appeal to the widest possible audience, normally, and 
   that probably means enforcing a no profanity rule.

2. Delete anything that is short and doesn't really say anything.  "I'm
   Pro-Choice/Life" as a whole post doesn't really say much. I delete those
   regularly. What is wanted are longer, well thought out, posts that say
   something. Another example is the "I agree" posts that are seen sometimes.

3. Quotes and Tag lines. This is something that I saw posted by the
   master, Wayne Bell himself, once. He pointed out that if somebody quotes 
   a long post and only adds a few lines of commentary such as "Your wrong."
   doesn't add much. Why post it. Say why the person is wrong is what would 
   be proper. Now, if a message has quotes in it from a previous message, 
   add up the quoted lines and if the added text exceeds the amount quoted, 
   then let it go through. It text from the poster is not equal to or greater
   than the quoted text, delete it. The network costs money, and Sysops don't
   need to be paying for a message to be sent out twice.

   Tag line length I also add it to the number of lines quoted. I don't see
   tag lines as worth while to the post. If 14 lines are quoted and there 
   is a 3 line tag line, that is at least 17 lines of text that should have 
   been added to it. If there are not at least 17 lines of added commentary,
   I normally delete the post.

4. Things that should have been said in e-mail : Somebody who posts something 
   like "Hey, Wizard. What's your phone number so I can call and talk to you 
   about this" should be deleted as well. Posts like that don't need to
   be read by the 100 or systems that subscribe the IceNET national General
   Sub. That is much easier to ask in e-mail.

5. Lastly, flaming and warring should be deleted. This probably goes
   without saying though.
   
[Flamecasting Editor's nOTE: Yeah, *right* Louie...:-)]!   

Except for the last point, there may be exceptions to each of these
general rules about deleting network posts. But exceptions are just that,
exceptions. They are not the general rule.

Just in case your wondering why these rules are important... They are
important because of the costs of the network. IceNET is run by Sysops that
pay phone bills for long distance calling. The LD bills cost more money the
longer they take and the more bytes in a net packet means more transmission
time. Thus, the sysops are then paying to have messages they (or there
users) don't really want to read sent to them.

On TGWN (IceNET @1) we host many subs. The IceNET National General Sub 
probably has about 1200 messages go out on it a month. That is 1200 posts 
that met the standards we use around here. There are probably 2000 total 
messages on it, but I delete a large number of them. Imagine the network 
costs if I didn't delete all the "I agree"/"Your Wrong" type of posts.

At the moment, I validate the following Subs hosted by TGWN on a regular
basis. The IceNET National General sub the busiest, by far... But the
Sports, Politics and Philosophy subs are big traffic net subs as well.
IceNET National General has about 90 subscribers, while those other three have

KEEPING TRACK OF POSTERS
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

There is something I like to do on boards I'm aCo-Sysop on: I will go through
uedit every now and then and compile a list of the top posters on the board. 
I then post it for all to see, as most people like to receive recognition for
their efforts. If some user has posted 300 times on a board, they might like 
to be singled out for the job well down. It also gives something for the new 
users to shoot for.


HELPING USERS
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

This is something that applies to all types of cosysops, but maybe a little 
more with message bases than in other areas. Message bases are what users 
read. They read, post and talk to people. If they have a problem doing this,
then help from theCo-Sysop will be appreciated a little more so than with 
other areas.


TRANSFER SECTION MANAGEMENT
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

I'm going to be up front with you here. I have never really done the job
of a Transfer Section cosysop, except in emergency situations at times when
the board wouldn't have any available disk space for posting. I would then
wander in to the Transfers and delete some old file that was 500k large or
something so that people could post again.

The two best cosysops I know who do the transfer section management
particularly well are Perseus (IceNET 9@7) and Trigger (Trigger@7654).

What this job entails, basically, is checking new uploads and keeping
files in the proper directorys (ie, Keeping games in the games section and
out of the business spreadsheets section).

Checking new uploads entails making sure things are newer software. Making 
sure the latest PD Stuff uploaded is the latest version. Making sure that 
there are no virii present by running the McAffee Stuff on the uploads. 
Making sure they are in the proper Zip format, or whatever the local standard
of compression is, Zip, Arc, Arj, Pak, ect... Locally we all use Zip, though 
we do have a few who love Arj around here. Arc, of course, is a dead issue.

It seems the accepted Standard we use on Paragon and TGWN are Zip compression.
We also have rules about keeping things virus free (da) and if a virus is 
detected we try to inform everybody we can of the program in question, who 
uploaded it, and weather it was intentional or not. We also like to have it 
so that all the available software is less then 1 year old, and that it is 
the lastest version of the PD program in question.

Jim is throughly anti-pirate software, and we do not tolerate pirate files 
being uploaded to us.

Also keeping files in the proper transfer directory is important as well. 
Keeping giffs in the giff directory. Keeping business software in the
business directory. This is important in order to give the users the best in
public domain downloads.

I think you could say that manageing the transfer section isn't difficult but
can be very time consumeing due to theCo-Sysop in question having to upload 
and download a lot.

We also like to think that Paragon is better at serving downloading sysops due
to its being a WWIV Source distribution site. Jim tells me that right now 
there are about 50-55 sysops with verifyed accounts on Paragon for that 
purpose. 


ONLINE CHAIN MANAGEMENT 
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

This is the person in charge of the games section in most cases. "Online
Chain Management" just sounds better, IMHO. TheCo-Sysop in charge of the 
chains makes sure that users are not just being game leeches. Makes sure 
that games are secondary and not the only reason people are calling.

This means that theCo-Sysop should go through the //LOG and //YLOG and
make sure people are posting if they are playing games. He might also run
the On-line Games sub, if there be such a sub on the system. Where people
could talk Tradewars, Globule Wars, Space Dynasty, ect...

One of the most popular games is Tradewars. A Co-Sysop in charge of running 
the games may be running a Tradewars Tournament. Personally, I think
tournament are nuts. I think the ideal tradewars game is in competeing
against other users, and not having to fight a Co-Sysop with Tedit as well. I
think the game is already close to perfect and doesn't need help to make it
better.

I should also note that I think making sure people are posting as well as 
playing games is more important than running Tournaments. Games should be 
secondary to posting.


USER RECORD MANAGEMENT
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

This means a variety of things. Making sure that users are posting, making
sure that new users are real people and not somebody looking to have a second
account with which to play Tradewars or leech more files and even deleteing
users that have not called in a long while.

The main thing of this job is voice validating users. Calling them and
telling them your calling from the BBS and saying your just making sure they
are real people. It might help to ask them a question about their account as
well. Asking their age might catch some 14 year old kid off guard who
claimed he was 23 so that he could have access to adult subs. You don't want
minors on subs like that. Legal problems as well as moral problems with
minors and adult material.

It can also entail giving out SL Raises. If a user is calling the board
and doing a good job posting, uploading, and not being a big game leech,
then after a certain length of time of doing well for the board they deserve
a reward of having more time on the board with which to be better. Usually I
would go through once a month, and if a user had continued to post a lot I
would give them a 10 point SL raise. The limit would be an 80 SL though.
Those with the high SL might even be considered for being made a Co-Sysop in
the future if another might be needed.

Deleteing old users that have not called in a while is a good idea as well. 
You don't want user records taking up space on the hard drive. And more users
in the files the slower than WWIV runs. Besides, you normally get several
users that call once and then never call back. No real sense in keeping those
persons around. They are not contributing to the board.

THE RESIDENT MOD EXPERT
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Heavily modded boards usually have a Sysop who mods his own board a lot.
Some boards, though, have sysops who can't program really. So since they
want a modded board, they would ask a BBSer who they know to be a good C
programmer to mod their board for them.

These are the type of people who know how to program in C, and are the
local Techie experts normally.
    
What makes for a good mod? Well, a good mod is something that has a function 
on the board. That simplifys sometime, or adds something that should be in 
WWIV normally. They also help to make a board have a slightly different look 
and feel from other wwiv boards. Now, don't get me wrong... I see very little
wrong with stock WWIV. There are some minor things I might add here and there
though. These are the reasons for mods.

While I'm on my soapbox here, I'd like to take a moment and comment on what I
feel is the worst mod ever created: the Random Title Mod. Sorry, but this mod
serves no useful purpose in my opinion. Sure, it's humorous the first few 
times you see it, but after seeing 100,000 random title the affect wears off.

If you want a good example of a good mod, that would be the mod that allows 
you to know what sub your reading while reading posts. Another good mod might
be the Sysop Avialiable for chat status that you see sometimes. 

In short, a mod should have a purpose. It shouldn't just be in for the sake 
of having another mod.


Co-Sysop OF ALL TRADES, MASTER OF NONE
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

This what what, I think, most cosysops really do. This combines everything 
from above, plus a little more. He talks with his Sysop a lot about board 
related things. The read and post on the subs, look at the logs and wander 
through Uedit and make sure that the users are all who they claim to be. 
Maybe play games. Basically, super users that help the Sysop of the board 
out.
    
There are several things a good WWIVCo-Sysop should do every call and pay 
attention to. They should almost always look at the sysops logs : //LOG, 
//YLOG,; the activity //ZLOG; the network info //NLOG and //PENDING; and 
look at the boards daily //STATUS. These are important commands that can
show you whats going on. You can then investigate things that look out of
place with regards to all the Co-Sysop jobs that I described.

Some other things that can be looked at and done are to make voting questions
with //IVOTES. Find out what people are thinking and look at what
democracy with the users might bring you. Just make sure that you don't give
them weird answers to give if you what serious feedback with the voting
section.

Manageing the general files section can be another minor thing to do.
Locally, in 716, we have a BBS publication called the WNY BBS Quarterly and
we like to have it in gfile sections on BBSes so that users around the area
can read it. So, I put it in the gfiles all the time when a new update of it
comes out. I also keep the BBS List on the boards straight. No use having
dead boards listed in the BBS List. So, every now and then, I edit the BBS
list and keep it updated. I take out old dead BBSes and add in the newer
boards that have gone up. This helps to keep people from asking every now
and then why they can't get through to some board that went down a year
ago...but that is still in BBS lists on boards around the area. At least
with the lists on TGWN and Paragon.

This has been a long article and I'm getting tired now. A lot of this is
philosophical thinkings on what a Co-Sysop should do. How to do it is another
all together. Different people have different ideas on how to get things
done. No one way is better than other ways. If what your doing works, don't
change it. I think a lot of new sysops and cosysops could use this advise
constructively. None of it is gospel and please don't take this all to mean
that I am preaching the word of the Holy Modem in the Sky or anything. ;-)

Been a while, hasn't it?

As I'm writing my monthly column for WWIVnews, I'm looking at the other 
machine, and taking note of who's calling. Why look, it's JAFO, wanting to
know where the latest WWIVnews is! Guess I should break into chat and 
tell him, eh?

Whoops! The little pes...er..guy logged off before I could get OS/2 to shell
over and let me access that particular window! Oh well, he'll just have to
look in his DATA directory just like everyone else I suppose.

What's that? You've been looking in your DATA directories as well, and
havn't seen a thing?

Guess you're entitled to an explanation, eh?

Well, this time around, things got piled up work wise, which eliminated 99%
of my free time, ruined a relationship that was just this side of popping
the question, and damn near caused me an ulcer in the process. Add to this
a network foulup, two system upgrades and a hard disk crash that wiped the
September-November issue off the face of the planet for all eternity.

It was enough to make a grown man switch to decaf, let me tell you...

However, two things did come to pass of positive nOTE: OM now has a *real*
machine from which to run the BBS, as well as one to run everything from
Doom to OS/2, and I've a job with a company that's put me in charge of their
tech support department.

With those in hand, who needs a wife with a kid anyway? Nobody, save for
me, perhaps...:-(

(Excuse me for a minute...I need to punt some idiot off who's complaining 
about not being able to post messages on her first logon...Hell, it's probably
just JAFO using a fake account anyway...)

There, that's done with. Anyway, the job situation of last year brings up
this month's OMsop's Fableless Moral. Without going into serious details
that would bore each of you to tears, let's just say the moral of that 
story is this:


OMsop's FABLELESS MORAL
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Kids, if you take on a contract job, make sure of two things:

     1) Your duties are spelled out to the letter, and that the rest of
        the staff is informed not to pester you for help on matters that
        do not pertain to your duties one iota.

     2) The person who hires you for the job is not a complete and utter
        idiot, and is capable of not only making rational decisions but
        dedicated to keeping promises made.

End of moral.

Now, WWIVnews is essentially back on schedule. The next issue is slated for
a March 31 release - about 4 weeks from now. This particular issue will be
a nonspecific issue, with no real theme. However, this will be followed on
April 15th by the first ever April Fool's issue of WWIVnews. With that in
mind, here's the official Call for Articles for that auspicious issue:


FORMAL CALL FOR ARTICLES: APRIL FOOL'S WWIVNEWS  
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ


Folks, WWIVnews is looking for a few good humorists, satirists, hoaxters,
pranksters, hosers, and anyone else who can spin a good yarn. For this issue,
we need humor articles that are close enough to be believeable, but are
recognizeable as phony when you finally read between the lines.

If you want a great example of how this should be done, go grab last April's
_PC Computing_ (and the April before that, too), and read Penn Jilette's
April Fool's column. That's what I'm looking for in the way of humor. Something
that's fake, but at first glance doesn't look like it.

This means articles on WWIV utils that are bogus as hell. This means mods
for WWIV that are bogus, worthless, and *not* written by Apollo. This means
TechNOTES reports on products that don't exist, can't exist, won't exist,
and probably exist only in Bill Gates' nightmares.

In short, I want a _National Lampoon_ send-off of WWIVnews for Tax Day. Most
of us are going to need that laugh right around then, and WWIVnews is going
to provide it.

So, send your article submissions in ASAP for this issue, as well as the
March 31 edition. As usual, I'll be soliciting articles left and right
for both issues, and rest assured I'll even see if I can get Wayne and
Filo to contribute a pair for their columns!

Oh, and as a side nOTE, names will be changed to protect the guilty. Not
by much, but they will be changed :-)

That's it for this issue. Keep those cards and letters coming in, folks!
