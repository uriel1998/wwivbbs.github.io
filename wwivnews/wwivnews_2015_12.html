                WWIV and WWIVNet Update From The New NC
                           By Weatherman 1@1

As many know, lots of things have been happening with WWIV BBS and 
WWIVnet over the past few years.  When Weather Station BBS came back 
online as a virtual machine around three years ago, the only networks 
that were available were FTN based.  About 7-8 months later, I was 
approached by Eli Sanford to join WWIVSN (the early beginnings of the
resurrected WWIVnet).  Eli spent lots of time helping others and 
leading the path so that we could have a functional WWIV network like 
years ago.

On a very sad day (October 26, 2015), our WWIVnet leader Eli Sanford 
passed from leukemia.  We were in shock and upset from the news. A few 
weeks went by as we were mourning the loss of Eli and then later, 
figuring out plans to keep WWIVnet alive.

We agreed to meet in the WWIV chat room on Monday evening to decide 
how to move forward.  The first item of business was determining the 
new @1 node for WWIVnet.  Rushfan suggested myself and the rest of 
the group was on-board with that change.  I was very humbled by the 
votes of support and encouragement.  It has been my passion to keep 
WWIV and WWIVnet alive in the most resiliant way possible.  My hardware
setup is robust for a home environment and offers a good deal 
redundancy. I will always do my best to make sure WWIVnet is running 
the best way possible.

That same night, we decided to make a historic change for WWIVnet.  
We switched the entire network from using WINS (PPP Project) to 
NetworkB (BinkP) written by Rushfan.  Given the magnatude of changes 
that we made that night, I think it went fantastic!  We have been 
running completely using BinkP for WWIVnet ever since.  It has proved 
to be a major step forward!  I can&#39;t thank Rushfan enough for writing 
that program, as that was a HUGE step forward!

In more recent news, we now have the ability to send out network 
updates using NetUp just like the legacy WWIVnet.  WSS provided a 
new version of NetUp for WWIVnet which has been working 
perfectly sending out network updates, subs listings, and even this
WWIVnet news.  This brings us back to the functionality that we had 
with the legacy WWIVnet.  It has been well over a decade since this was
possible.

I am completely honored to be a part of such an excellent group of 
people that have done so much for WWIV and WWIVnet in the past few 
years. Highlighting the past few months as just nothing short of 
incredible with the move to NetworkB (BinkP).  That was as huge of a 
change for WWIVnet as when we started moving network packets using 
Frank Reid&#39;s PPP Project (SMTP).

This has been a very fun road for our hobby and I&#39;m very excited for 
what the future holds.  I&#39;m sure as more people discover our 
milestones, additional people will re-connect and join our fantastic 
group.  We will also not forget Eli and all the hard work he did to 
start the WWIVnet comeback.

Here is a toast to the bright future of WWIV and WWIVnet!

                        WWIV 5.1 Release Goals
                            By Rushfan 1@514

                            Main Themes
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~
Messages and WWIVNet have always been at the heart of WWIV. For 5.1, I 
plan on modernizing and improving the internal code quality of the 
messaging code, making it easier to embed into new tools. Included in 
this will be support for the JAM Message Base format to broaden the 
range of tools available for exposing message bases.

More on JAM: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAM_Message_Base_Format

Net38 will be finalized [currently Beta 6] and released supporting any 
new changes to get WWIVNet functioning in the Internet era.
