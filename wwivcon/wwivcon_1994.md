|           New Orleans, Louisiana          July 1 - July 3, 1994           |
|                                                                           |

Q:  What is WWIVcon?

A:  WWIVcon is a WWIV convention.  The first one is to be held in New
    Orleans.

Q:  Who may attend?

A:  Anyone who is interested in WWIV may attend.  Those who do not stay
    at the convention hotel will be asked to register in advance and pay
    a conference fee to cover costs like meals and so forth.

Q:  Where will it be in New Orleans?

A:   Comfort Inn
     1315 Gravier Street.
     New Orleans, La 70112

    If you write for reservations, address it to ATTN: Reservations.
    If you wish to call and reserve a room (on credit card or
    something),

The number to call to make your reservation is 800-535-9141. The Sales manager
handling this is Esther Holguin (pronounced Hole-Kwin).  The first night's
lodging must be prepaid to guarantee your reservation.  This is $55, plus 11%
Sales Tax (I told ya we had the highest in the nation!),plus a $2.00 per night
city occupancy tax.  Ballparking, I'd guess that'd put it at about $62.50
(I don't have a calculator handy)  Have your Credit Card handy.

Q:  What is the agenda for the convention?

A:  The following activities are planned so far:

    July 1 (Friday night)  : Welcome Social at Hotel (7 - 9 pm roughly)

    July 2 (Saturday day)  : Seminars and speakers on various topics

    July 2 (Saturday night): Awards banquet

    July 3 (Sunday morning): Additional Seminars and send-off

Q:  When can I make my reservations?

A:  You can begin calling the hotel now (see information above) to
    reserve your room.  The earlier that you make your reservation, the
    easier that it is for us to plan the event and you are assured of
    getting a room at the hotel.  (I hope that we can book all the rooms
    in the hotel by October or so).

    If we can get the hotel booked up as early as that, we can approach
    some corporate sponsers (like Borland) to see if they will throw
    together some freebies for us.

|          WWIV Con '94 Registration Information and Instructions           |
|                                                                           |
|                      New Orleans WWIV Weekend 1994                        |
|                             July 1-3, 1994                                |

WWIV Con '94 (New Orleans WWIV Weekend 1994) is a WWIV Convention--the first
of its kind.  Anyone who is interested in WWIV in invited to attend.  WWIV
Con '94 will be held in New Orleans, Louisiana July 1-3, 1994 (Friday through
Sunday).  It's going to be an exciting opportunity to meet and get together
with others with whom we share networking and BBSing in general.  All the
"major" WWIV-based networks will be represented, and most of the "minor"
networks as well.  All are welcome.

There are three main reasons for having registration fees.  First, and by
far the most important, is to encourage everyone to register early.  We are
attempting to convince a number of computer-related corporations (like
Microsoft, Borland, and Symantec) to participate.  The corporate "sponsors"
will be invited to conduct seminars, give away door prizes, host hospitality
suites, or whatever other "freebies" they want to give us.  In order to
convince the "giants" to come, we need to be able to tell them how many
people will be attending, and have some "hard" evidence to show that we
really will have that many people.  Because the large companies plan so far
ahead, we simply MUST have some numbers very soon.  NOTE:  YOU CAN MAKE YOUR
RESERVATION AT THE COMFORT INN, AND IF SOMETHING COMES UP AND YOU CAN'T
ATTEND, YOU CAN CANCEL YOUR RESERVATION WITHOUT PENALTY AS LONG AS YOU DO SO
A MONTH IN ADVANCE.

Second, the people who stay at the Comfort Inn are contributing to WWIV Con
'94 by staying at the Comfort Inn--their room rent helps pay for the meeting
room the Comfort Inn is providing.  The registration fees for those who are
NOT staying at the Comfort Inn are a way for others to help defray part of
the cost of holding WWIV Con '94.

Finally, there will be some expenses involved in putting together packets for
all the registrants, and there will be some miscellaneous expenses involved
as well.  Registration fees will help defray those expenses.  Our goal is to
"break even;" any money left over after expenses will be used for door
prizes, free meals for participants, or some other benefit for registrants,
depending on how much money is available.

Convention packets, including an ID badge, will be prepared for each
registrant and will be distributed at WWIV Con '94.

|                              INSTRUCTIONS:                                |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

1.  If you make reservations at the Comfort Inn by November 1, 1993, you
    get FREE registration for all the people staying in your room.  You must
    give us a separate registration form for each person, though, so we can
    create a convention packet for them and create their ID badge which will]
    give them admission to all WWIV Con '94 events.

2.  If you are NOT staying at the Comfort Inn, you may register by sending in
    this registration form.  If you register by November 1, 1993, the
    registration is only $5.00 (what a bargain!).

3.  If you ARE staying at the Comfort Inn, and you make reservations between
    November 2, 1993 and April 1, 1994, the registration for WWIVcon '94
    for you and each person in your room who will be attending any convention
    activities is $10.00 per person.  You must send us the $10.00 per person
    and send in a separate registration form form each convention attendee;
    registration forms and fees should get to us by April 1, 1994.

4.  If you are NOT staying at the Comfort Inn, and you register between
    November 2, 1993 and April 1, 1994, your registration fee will be
    $15.00 per person.  You must send us your registration fee and
    registration form by April 1, 1994 to qualify for this reduced rate.

5.  Whether or not you stay at the Comfort Inn, if you register on April 2,
    1994 or later, the registration fee is $25.00 per person.  The purpose
    of this higher registration fee is NOT to raise revenue, but to encourage
    everyone to register early, for the reasons already explained.
